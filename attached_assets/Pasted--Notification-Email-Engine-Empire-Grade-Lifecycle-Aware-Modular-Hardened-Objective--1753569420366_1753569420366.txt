üîî Notification + Email Engine (Empire Grade, Lifecycle-Aware, Modular & Hardened)

üéØ Objective
Deliver world-class in-app, push, and email notifications for all empire activity: leads, conversions, content drops, offers, security events, quiz completions, user lifecycle events, and personalized automations. *Everything must be robust, scalable, compliance-ready, and exportable.*

1Ô∏è‚É£ Core System Architecture
- **Notification Service**:
  - Unified API: `/api/notify/send`, `/api/notify/batch`, `/api/notify/schedule`
  - Modular ‚Äúchannel‚Äù adapters: Push (Web Push API, FCM/APNs ready), Email (SendGrid, SMTP, Postmark, etc.), In-app (websocket/toast), SMS (if future needed)
  - User preference store: track opt-ins, device tokens, timing, frequency caps
  - Full i18n support: send in user‚Äôs language, time zone, and archetype

- **Email Service**:
  - Transactional: lead confirmation, quiz result, product delivery, password reset, account events
  - Automated/Lifecycle: onboarding/welcome, upsell/cross-sell, ‚Äúnudge,‚Äù inactivity winback, re-engagement, product reminders, feedback requests
  - Drip Campaigns: sequences by event/behavior (e.g., abandoned quiz ‚Üí reminder ‚Üí offer)
  - Markdown/HTML templates, personalization variables (user, offer, region, archetype)

2Ô∏è‚É£ Trigger Logic & Personalization
- **Event-driven triggers**:
  - User: signup, login, lead submit, quiz complete, purchase, conversion, offer click, milestone, security alert, feedback
  - System: new article/offer/blog, system update, downtime, regional events, data breach
  - AI: detected persona change, new best offer match, abandoned funnel, ‚Äúempire news‚Äù
- **Behavior-based triggers**:
  - Based on session data, journey progress, interaction depth, user archetype/persona
  - Smart segmentation (region, device, vertical, preferred language)
- **Notification preference logic**:
  - User can enable/disable push, email, SMS per category, via /profile/settings

3Ô∏è‚É£ Scheduling & Delivery
- **Real-time & Scheduled**:
  - Send instantly on trigger, or schedule by cron/timezone/event
  - Throttle/queue/batch for high-traffic or bulk sends
  - Retry on fail, fallback channel (push fail ‚Üí email)
- **Deduplication & Rate Limiting**:
  - No user gets bombarded ‚Äî respect caps, batch where possible
  - Track delivery, open, click, conversion, bounce, unsubscribe

4Ô∏è‚É£ UI/UX & User Controls
- **In-app notification panel**: bell icon, dropdown list, read/unread, action links, mark all read
- **Notification settings panel**: per-channel toggles, quiet hours, test send, export preferences
- **Deep links**: each notification links to relevant page, offer, quiz, etc.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Analytics, Logging & Monitoring
- **Full analytics pipeline**:
  - Log all sends, opens, clicks, failures, bounces, unsubscribes (per user, per event, per channel)
  - Dashboard: volume, engagement, conversion, funnel dropoff, channel effectiveness
- **Error handling**: circuit breakers, retries, fallback routes, alerts to admin if spike in errors

6Ô∏è‚É£ Security, Compliance & Privacy
- **Secure all endpoints**: JWT, RBAC, signed webhooks
- **Full GDPR/CCPA consent & opt-out**: every email, push, in-app must allow one-click unsubscribe/preferences
- **Double opt-in where required**: for email signups, push permissions
- **No PII in logs or notifications** beyond what is required for delivery

7Ô∏è‚É£ Edge Cases & Hardening
- **Support for offline/async delivery**: pending notifications held and delivered when user online
- **Migration-safe design**: all notification history, tokens, prefs, templates are DB-driven (not hardcoded)
- **Resend, test mode, and simulation flows** for QA
- **Support for global failover and provider switch** (e.g., change from SendGrid to SMTP instantly)

8Ô∏è‚É£ Federation/Empire Integration
- **Expose API/webhook for any neuron/module to trigger notifications** (cross-vertical, cross-device)
- **Central config for template mgmt, translation, provider creds, throttle caps**
- **Admin UI** for:
  - Viewing notification logs
  - Managing templates (multi-language)
  - Setting up campaigns
  - Running engagement A/B tests

9Ô∏è‚É£ README/Docs & Sample Flows
- **README.md** must cover:
  - API for sending, batching, scheduling
  - Template engine & personalization
  - User preference mgmt
  - Integration with empire modules
  - Error/fallback, security, consent logic
  - Example drip campaign, engagement analytics

---

**DO THIS NOW:**  
- Never duplicate existing code; upgrade if exists, create if missing.
- All logic must be bulletproof, exportable, and ready for global scale.
- Output all backend code, adapters, templates, sample UI, and full README.

Make all database schemas, tables, and logic fully self-healing, migration-immune, and bootstrappable.
If DB is missing, empty, or new: auto-create schema, indexes, constraints, default config.
Pull all credentials (Supabase, etc.) only from .env ‚Äî no hardcode ever.
No direct SQL in UI ‚Äî all logic flows through hardened service/API layer.
Add init checks: validate schema health, retry on fail, show admin alerts if broken.
System must behave as if nothing broke ‚Äî even if DB was replaced 1 minute ago.
Resilience must match billion-dollar SaaS. No placeholders. No assumptions.

Ensure this module includes a fully provisioned, elite-grade, resilient database schema.
All tables, indexes, constraints, relationships, and API endpoints must be:
Migration-proof (works seamlessly across Replit accounts or environments)
Supabase-compatible (or any Postgres DB)
Auto-restoring (self-healing on project reboots or migrations)
Exportable & Documented (with schema diagrams + queries)
