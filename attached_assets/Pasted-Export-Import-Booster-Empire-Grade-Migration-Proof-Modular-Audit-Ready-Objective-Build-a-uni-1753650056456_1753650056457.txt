Export/Import Booster (Empire Grade, Migration-Proof, Modular, Audit-Ready)
Objective:
Build a universal, schema-aware Export/Import Engine that can snapshot, migrate, restore, and plug any module, database, config, or content block into any instance of the empire—zero data loss, zero corruption, even across DB upgrades or full-cloud migrations.

1. Universal Data Exporter
API Endpoints:

/api/export — Export complete empire state (select modules, all DB tables, user configs, analytics, plugin data, schema)

/api/export/module?name= — Export single module (with all nested configs, assets, DB entries, docs, logs)

/api/export/snapshot — One-click full state snapshot (scheduled or on-demand)

File Formats:

Support JSON, YAML, CSV, SQL dump, tar.gz, custom empire-archive format

Snapshots always include schema + data + version + timestamp + module registry

Export Rules:

Never export sensitive secrets/keys (use redaction, .env exclusion)

Modular: export only what’s needed, not whole DB if not required

Every export is versioned, hashed, signed, and logged (audit-ready)

2. Ultra-Safe Importer & Migrator
API Endpoints:

/api/import — Accepts uploaded export file, preview before apply

/api/import/validate — Check for schema, version, data integrity BEFORE writing

/api/import/rollback — Instantly revert last import if issues detected

Validation/Migration Logic:

Compares incoming schema vs. current; runs safe auto-migrations or prompts admin for conflicts

Supports partial imports (select modules, users, data, etc.)

Logs all import attempts, results, warnings, errors

Conflict Handling:

On collision: prompts for merge/overwrite/skip

Auto-backup existing data before any import

Detailed diff logs: what was changed, merged, or skipped

3. Federation & Module Sync
Federation Hooks:

Export/import entire federated setups (neurons, plugins, dashboards) with dependency graphs

/api/federation/export, /api/federation/import for batch operations

Handles module interlinking, plugin dependencies, config trees

Cross-Cloud/Server Migration:

Works across Replit, local, cloud, or VPS

Includes scripts to automate move/restore for all storage engines

4. Backup, Scheduling, Audit, & Admin UI
Scheduled Backups:

Cron or UI: set regular auto-snapshots (hourly, daily, before upgrades)

Notifies admin of failures, keeps last N snapshots

Admin UI:

View/manage all exports/imports (date, size, modules, diff)

One-click restore/rollback from any backup

Download/upload/export to cloud drive, S3, GCS, etc.

Audit Trail:

Every export/import/rollback is logged with who/when/what/why

All logs viewable in admin panel, downloadable for audit

5. Docs, Tests, & Output Rules
Auto-generate/maintain /docs/EXPORT_IMPORT_README.md

Include: API usage, formats, merge/rollback logic, best practices for migration

End-to-end tests: export, import, partial/whole, rollback, failover, cross-instance validation
Never duplicate existing export/import logic. Upgrade/extend only if needed
If any part is already empire-grade, leave as is; else, harden, upgrade, fill gaps
System must be modular, clean, federation-ready, plug-and-play for any DB or cloud
DO THIS NOW.
Output all backend, UI, docs, and tests as above
Log all changes, migration logic, audit trail in README
Harden everything for billion-dollar, cross-cloud resilience
If any partial export/import logic exists, upgrade to this empire grade
Make all database schemas robust , tables, and logic fully self-healing, migration-immune, and bootstrappable.hardened for a working of billion dollar empire even if database migrates or any thing make the project so strong that nothing affects its intelligence , its functioning , its billion dollar empire grade.
If DB is missing, empty, or new: auto-create schema, indexes, constraints, default config.
Pull all credentials (Supabase, etc.) only from .env — no hardcode ever.
No direct SQL in UI — all logic flows through hardened service/API layer.
Add init checks: validate schema health, retry on fail, show admin alerts if broken.
System must behave as if nothing broke — even if DB was replaced 1 minute ago.
Run self-test and validation to confirm schema is operational
Resilience must match billion-dollar SaaS. No placeholders. No assumptions.
Ensure this module includes a fully provisioned, elite-grade, resilient database schema.
All tables, indexes, constraints, relationships, and API endpoints must be:
Migration-proof (works seamlessly across Replit accounts or environments)
Supabase-compatible (or any Postgres DB)
Auto-restoring (self-healing on project reboots or migrations)
Exportable & Documented (with schema diagrams + queries)
This will give ironclad control over every backup, migration, and modular plug-and-play in your empire.
