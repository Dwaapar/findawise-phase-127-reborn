Revenue Split Manager & Profit Forecast Engine (Empire-Grade Build)
Objective:
Build a robust, enterprise-class Revenue Split Manager and Profit Forecast Engine for the Findawise Empire. This module must support affiliate and product revenue splits, partner payouts, multi-level commissions, and forward-looking profit analytics—at scale.

💰 Revenue Split Manager
Features:

Configurable Split Logic:

Support multiple commission structures: flat, tiered, custom per partner, offer, or neuron.

Easily assign percentages or rules to any affiliate/product revenue stream.

Configurable via admin dashboard UI and config files.

Automated Payouts & Logging:

Track revenue per partner/affiliate.

Auto-calculate monthly/weekly/daily payouts.

Export payout reports (CSV, JSON, PDF).

Support for payment provider integration (PayPal, Stripe, Wise, UPI—leave as stubs or add full integration if possible).

Dashboard UI:

/admin/revenue-split:

View all splits, earnings, payouts, partner performance, upcoming splits.

Graphs/charts: splits over time, partner share, payout status.

Export reports and manual override controls.

Federation/Neuron Sync:

Each neuron/module can report its own revenue; manager aggregates for global and per-neuron splits.

Live updates on dashboard when splits or rules change.

Audit trail of all split config and payout history.

Security & Compliance:

Full role-based access (only admins can edit splits).

Payout approvals/locking.

Exportable audit logs for finance/legal review.

📈 Profit Forecast Engine
Features:

Forecasting:

Auto-project future profits based on historical data (last 30/90/180 days), split rules, growth rates, and seasonal adjustments.

Visual charts of predicted revenue, splits, and net profits per partner/vertical.

Export forecast reports.

Use basic ML (e.g., linear regression, moving average, or plug to advanced ML if available).

Risk/Scenario Analysis:

“What if” tool: simulate different split rules, partner additions, and offer changes.

Highlight best/worst-case scenarios for each partner and the empire.

📘 README (MANDATORY)
Must include:

Overview of split manager and forecast logic.

API usage for programmatic reporting and split changes.

Example config files and sample payouts.

Security, audit, and compliance practices.

Step-by-step “How to add a new partner, set custom split, and export payouts.”

🟢 Upgrade/No Duplication Rule
❗️Do NOT duplicate any existing code, modules, or logic.

Upgrade/extend any partial revenue split logic already present.

Harden and finish all related modules in place.

Output a summary of planned upgrades vs. current code before making changes.

Build as a modular, production-grade system, ready to scale globally, and compatible with all existing Findawise empire logic.
