PWA + Mobile App Wrapper (Findawise Empire Grade — AI-Native, Installable, Push-Driven, App-Store Ready)
🎯 Mission:
Transform the entire Findawise Empire into a self-contained, installable, offline-capable Progressive Web App and cross-platform mobile app that behaves like a native app — with full AI trigger compatibility, smart install logic, and real-time sync.

🔩 1. PWA Core Intelligence Layer
Implement advanced service-worker.js with:

Static + dynamic route caching (home, category, quiz, offers, tools, blog, search)

Stale-while-revalidate, intelligent cache expiration, versioned cache naming

Background sync for queued form submits, quizzes, or CTA interactions while offline

Add full manifest.json:

App name, theme color, background color, app icons (96px–512px), splash screen images

Shortcuts: e.g. offers, latest blog, run quiz, track order

Display mode: standalone + fullscreen fallback

Responsive, mobile-first UI:

Fixed nav/tab bar for PWA (Android-style bottom nav)

Long-press, swipe-back, scroll-hold interactions

Offline banner with reconnect logic

🔔 2. Push Notification & Trigger Engine
Use OneSignal, FCM, or open-source alternatives with VAPID

Real-time triggers from:

Price drop

New article

AI-identified high-converting offer

LLM-upgraded content suggestion

User permission logic:

Silent opt-in on repeat visit + prompt-on-engagement

Custom topic segmentation (blog, AI tools, finance offers, eBooks, new neuron)

🗂 3. Mobile App Wrapper (App Store Ready)
Use Capacitor.js or Expo WebView for native export

Features:

Deep linking to /quiz, /offer, /blog

Push support via mobile channel (not just web)

Secure user storage (session.json, bookmarks, AI responses)

Biometric login fallback (future-proofed)

Custom splash, loading animation, device vibration API

🔗 4. Smart Install & Usage Nudges
Custom install logic:

Show install banners only after 2nd visit, quiz finish, or AI engagement spike

Smart timing: avoid install prompt spam, remind post-conversion

Track install → open → uninstall funnel with events in localStorage + Plausible/Umami

Show usage perks: “Install to unlock offline reading, instant tools, smart deals, AI chat"

⚙️ 5. Admin + User Control Panel
/admin/pwa-engine dashboard:

Cache status, file/version logs, test update swipes

Upload/update manifest, icons, splash screens

Configure push topics, smart install rules, install CTA logic

User panel (/settings/notifications):

Enable/disable push by topic

Clear cache/offline data

Manage install shortcuts (custom per user if needed)

🧠 6. AI & Federation Compatibility
All push, install, content prompts must integrate with:

Semantic Graph intent

Session vector profile

Federation triggers from other neurons

“AI-powered app wrapper” — each vertical neuron has its own tab/app section

Export modules:

push-trigger.js, pwa-bootstrap.js, service-worker.js, mobile-wrapper-config.json

📘 7. README (MANDATORY)
How to:

Turn site into PWA + install

Export wrapper to Android/iOS

Test push triggers (CLI/API/scripts)

Add new push topics / service worker modules

Include:

Sample manifests, CLI build scripts, device test matrix, Lighthouse benchmark

💥 OUTPUT RULES:
No demo. No stub. Deliver a real installable/testable PWA with push, offline, and admin dashboard.

Must pass:

Lighthouse PWA > 95

Mobile usability > 95

Push and install test on Android/Chrome, iOS/Safari

All code modular, federation-enabled, AI-integrated, future-scalable.
