Neural User Profile System (Cross-Device, Empire Grade, DB-Ready)
üéØ Objective
Build a Neural User Profile Engine that seamlessly tracks, persists, and evolves every user‚Äôs journey, preferences, device history, and archetype ‚Äî across all devices, browsers, and modules in the empire.

1. Core System Architecture
Hybrid Storage:

Store core profile in local/sessionStorage for fast access.

Sync/backup all profiles to a cloud database (Postgres/Supabase/your DB layer), supporting cross-device, multi-session login.

Profile Schema (extendable):

userId, email (if registered), anonId (device/user key),

deviceList, lastSeen, sessionTokens,

userArchetype (segment/quiz),

recentActivity (pages, quizzes, offers, interactions),

preferredLanguage, geoLocation,

consentStatus, cookiePrefs,

conversionHistory, favorites,

profileMeta: custom fields for future features.

2. Cross-Device/Session Sync Logic
On New Device or Browser:

Prompt user for optional sign-in or anonymous linking (via magic link, email, or one-time code).

If no sign-in, generate a new anonId and sync on backend if possible.

On Each Session:

Merge activity and profile history (if same userId/email detected).

Auto-sync profile updates to backend DB (use REST/API/Websocket).

3. Analytics & Activity Tracking
Track in Real-Time:

Pageviews, scrolls, quiz answers, CTA/interactions, offer clicks, purchases, lead forms, etc.

Persist activity snapshots into profile (for personalization, AI, rewards).

Store deep engagement data (time on site, engagement flow, dropoff points).

4. Archetype & Personalization
Update and Store:

Quiz outcomes, persona/fusion scores, session context, favorite topics/offers.

Adapt profile with AI (Orchestrator) for dynamic content/offers.

AI/ML Ready:

Profile is ready for clustering, LLM-driven personalization, intent mapping, and more.

5. Security & Compliance
Data Security:

JWT-auth for sensitive endpoints, hashed IDs in storage, all API access logged.

Privacy Controls:

User can view/export/delete full profile.

Full GDPR/CCPA consent flows and compliance.

‚ÄúErase Me‚Äù API endpoint (removes all data for a user across the empire).

6. Federation/Empire Integration
API/Interface:

Expose /api/user/profile, /api/user/activity, /api/user/sync, /api/user/erase

Any neuron/module can pull and update profile, always via RBAC/JWT auth.

Central Dashboard:

Admin UI for searching, viewing, and exporting user profiles, activity logs, and consent status.

7. Docs, README & Test Coverage
README.md must include:

Schema definition

How profiles sync across device/browser

API usage (get, update, erase)

Security, privacy, and export flows

Example admin dashboard queries

How to extend profile logic (custom fields, AI sync, consent extensions)

Test Coverage:

Add unit/integration tests for:

Profile creation, sync, merge, erase

API auth, RBAC

Consent toggles/flows

Activity tracking

8. Final Rules
Do not duplicate any existing code or profile logic.

Upgrade existing profile, sync, and activity logic to this new schema.

If local DB not yet provisioned, use API stubs, local mocks, or comments for DB sync logic.

Prepare everything for ‚Äúplug-and-play‚Äù upgrade once DB is ready.

No shortcuts ‚Äî make the system modular, exportable, and bulletproof.

Log all changes and document everything in README.

DO THIS NOW. Output the full code, all upgrades, all tests, and the README.
If any existing functionality is already empire grade, only upgrade/extend.
If anything is missing, add and integrate it fully.
This system must be ready for final billion-dollar deployment.
