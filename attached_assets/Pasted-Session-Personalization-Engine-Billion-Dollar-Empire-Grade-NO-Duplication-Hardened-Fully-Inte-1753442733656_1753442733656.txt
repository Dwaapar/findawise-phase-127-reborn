Session + Personalization Engine
(Billion Dollar Empire Grade, NO Duplication, Hardened, Fully Integrated)

üî• MANDATORY OBJECTIVE
You are to audit, harden, and complete the Session + Personalization Engine for the Findawise Empire.
NO code or logic duplication allowed. Only extend, refactor, or merge what‚Äôs already present and build whatever is missing and this all should be billion dollar empire grade.`

I. AUDIT & INVENTORY
Begin by scanning all existing session/profile/user personalization code (front and backend).

List:

What logic exists (session, profile, journey, user data collection, personalization, segmentation, dashboard).

Where partial/incomplete flows exist.

What files will be updated/extended.

II. SESSION ENGINE (Persistent, Cross-Device, Privacy-First)
Persistent Session Tracking:

Implement universal, privacy-compliant user IDs (cookie/JWT/localStorage/account).

Persist all session/user profile data to secure backend (cloud DB, NOT local-only).

On session start, always hydrate from backend (cross-device, cross-browser compatible).

Data Captured:

Page visits, time, clickstreams, quizzes taken, blog/article reads, offers clicked, forms filled, conversions, device info, session length, entry/exit points.

‚ÄúIntent fingerprint‚Äù/archetype tags (e.g., ‚Äúbargain-hunter‚Äù, ‚ÄúDIY‚Äù, ‚Äúpassive-income-seeker‚Äù).

Last activity timestamp, first seen, repeat visit flags.

Survival Across:

Browser clears, logout/login, new device, tab close/reopen.

III. PERSONALIZATION ENGINE (Real-Time, Deep, AI-Ready)
Real-Time Personalization:

Dynamically adjust:

Homepage hero, blog/offer modules, CTA copy, product stack, color schemes.

Quiz/lead magnet placement based on user journey/archetype.

Support segment-based rendering (e.g., ‚Äúshow exclusive offer for returning renters‚Äù).

Segmentation:

Auto-classify users: New, returning, high-intent, low-engagement, archetypes (use quizzes + behavior).

‚ÄúPersonalized for You‚Äù banners, recommendations, and smart notifications.

Personalization Admin Panel:

/admin/session-dashboard:

View, filter, search, and edit anonymized user profiles/journeys.

Visualize common journeys, top archetypes, drop-off points.

Export anonymized data as CSV/JSON.

Edit/test personalization logic live.

AI/ML Ready:

Stub in hooks for future integration of AI-powered segmentation, offer ranking, user journey prediction (future).

IV. PRIVACY, SECURITY, & COMPLIANCE
GDPR/CCPA/Privacy-by-Design:

Explicit opt-in/opt-out for all personalization.

‚ÄúErase me‚Äù button/endpoint: wipes all user/session/profile data.

Consent status saved per user and enforced everywhere.

Security:

RBAC for all admin/session dashboard endpoints.

All session/profile API calls must check JWT + user role.

Log every profile/session mutation with timestamp, module, and summary.

V. FEDERATION & SYNCHRONIZATION
API Endpoints:

All neurons can call core API to:

Read/write user session/profile

Erase profile (with consent)

Push new journey/behavior events

No duplication‚Äîextend only.

All modules to register session events with the Engine (quiz taken, offer clicked, article read, etc).

VI. README (MANDATORY, UPDATED)
Complete new section: ‚ÄúSession + Personalization Engine‚Äù

What the engine does (plain English)

Full API docs: session/profile endpoints, data schema

Personalization/segmentation logic and samples

Privacy/compliance details

Federation integration guide

How to extend for AI/ML

Export/import instructions

VII. FINAL HARDENING & VERIFICATION
Harden all code:

Edge-case handling, error logging, rate limits, input validation, security checks.

DO NOT duplicate or overwrite existing working modules,upgrade them to empire grade level and add what is missing.

Only add what‚Äôs missing or incomplete.

If legacy/partial, merge, upgrade, and document.

Go for ‚Äúbillion dollar, global SaaS‚Äù robustness. No unfinished flows, no shortcuts, no token-saving. Output must be modular, ready for scale, and ready for AI/ML extension.
