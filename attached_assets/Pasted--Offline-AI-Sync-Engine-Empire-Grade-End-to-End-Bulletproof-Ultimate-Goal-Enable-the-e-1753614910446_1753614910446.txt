üîÅ Offline AI Sync Engine (Empire Grade, End-to-End, Bulletproof)

üéØ Ultimate Goal:
Enable the entire empire to function, record, and evolve while offline, and synchronize seamlessly when back online, with no loss, no conflict, and fully secure.  
AI personalization, quiz progress, user journeys, content, analytics, and offer actions all work *even if the internet dies*.

1. **Local-First Storage & Sync Architecture**
   - All key data (user profiles, quiz flows, session analytics, preferences, CTA clicks, local offer cache, drafts, content, feedback) is persisted in:
     - IndexedDB (browser), SQLite/local DB (native), secure storage for mobile/PWA
   - Modular local cache for AI/ML models, personalization configs, quizzes, and offers
   - Works in: browser, PWA, native wrapper, and even on slow/unstable 2G

2. **AI & Personalization Logic‚ÄîLocal-First**
   - Ship a subset of lightweight personalization logic (scoring, quizzes, recommendations) as client-side JS/TS or mobile-native
   - Local inference for session-based recommendations, quiz results, and intent classification (WebAssembly or WASM ML models if possible)
   - ‚ÄúMini Orchestrator‚Äù: auto-adapts offers/CTAs/content to user even offline

3. **Real-Time & Deferred Sync Engine**
   - Detects online/offline state instantly
   - While offline: 
     - Log all user events/actions with timestamp and context
     - Store all data mutations as a queue
   - On reconnect:
     - Sync all queued events to backend (POST/api/batch/events, /api/profile/sync, /api/quiz/progress)
     - Sync any missed content updates, new offers, configs, and resolved AI models
   - Handles merge conflicts, data versioning, ‚Äúlast write wins‚Äù or ‚ÄúAI-diff merge‚Äù

4. **End-to-End Security & Integrity**
   - All offline data is encrypted at rest (crypto-js/AES or device native)
   - JWT-auth required for any sensitive sync on reconnect
   - Detects tampering‚Äîrejects manipulated data, alert for audit

5. **UX & UI**
   - User sees ‚ÄúYou are offline‚Äîyour work is saved and will sync automatically‚Äù with live sync status
   - Manual sync button + auto-retry/backoff for unstable connections
   - Show ‚ÄúAI is still working for you offline‚Äù badge when relevant

6. **Extensibility & Federation**
   - Any module/neuron can register its own offline cache and sync logic
   - Pluggable to quizzes, lead forms, CTAs, affiliate actions, blog edits, even AR/VR modules
   - Sync queue is modular: other neurons/modules push/pull events seamlessly

7. **README & Docs**
   - README.md must explain:
     - Offline data flows and storage schema
     - How to implement offline support in a new module
     - Security and encryption details
     - Sync conflict resolution, audit trail, rollback
     - Example scenarios: quiz offline, affiliate click offline, content draft offline, etc.

8. **Final Output Rules**
   - No placeholder code‚Äîeverything real, fully modular, production-grade
   - No duplicate logic‚Äîmerge/upgrade any existing offline logic
   - If core logic already exists, harden and make modular for all modules
   - All changes, queue structures, and offline-aware events documented in README
   - All data and AI logic is ready for instant local/remote migration and recovery


Make all database schemas, tables, and logic fully self-healing, migration-immune, and bootstrappable.
If DB is missing, empty, or new: auto-create schema, indexes, constraints, default config.
Pull all credentials (Supabase, etc.) only from .env ‚Äî no hardcode ever.
No direct SQL in UI ‚Äî all logic flows through hardened service/API layer.
Add init checks: validate schema health, retry on fail, show admin alerts if broken.
System must behave as if nothing broke ‚Äî even if DB was replaced 1 minute ago.
Resilience must match billion-dollar SaaS. No placeholders. No assumptions.
Ensure this module includes a fully provisioned, elite-grade, resilient database schema.
All tables, indexes, constraints, relationships, and API endpoints must be:
Migration-proof (works seamlessly across Replit accounts or environments)
Supabase-compatible (or any Postgres DB)
Auto-restoring (self-healing on project reboots or migrations)
Exportable & Documented (with schema diagrams + queries)

**DO THIS NOW. Output all offline sync modules, event queues, security/encryption, UI, docs, and integration points.**  
If anything is already built, harden it. If missing, build now. Must be ready for global, mobile, and edge users, empire-wide.
