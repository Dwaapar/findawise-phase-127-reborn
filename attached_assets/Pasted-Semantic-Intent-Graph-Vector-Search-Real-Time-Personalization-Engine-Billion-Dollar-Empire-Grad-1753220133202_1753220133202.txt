Semantic Intent Graph + Vector Search & Real-Time Personalization Engine (Billion-Dollar Empire Grade)

🎯 Ultimate Objective:
Build a real-time semantic intelligence layer that deeply understands every part of your empire — pages, quizzes, offers, content blocks, neurons — and evolves itself through user interaction, embeddings, and intent-driven optimization.

🔩 1. Semantic Graph Data Structure (Self-Evolving)
- Create a scalable graph schema (Postgres + JSONB for now; port-ready to Neo4j, RedisGraph, or ChromaDB).
- Node Types: page, quiz, offer, user_archetype, cta_block, neuron, blog_post, tag, vertical, session_profile, and custom plugin/AI agent nodes.
- Edge Types: related_to, solves, leads_to, upsell_from, segment_for, matches_intent, influences, triggered_by, orphaned, popular_path, discovered_by, LLM_suggested_link, and future extensible edge types.
- All nodes include metadata (slug, niche, emotion, last_updated, embeddings, CTR, conversions), editable config via /admin/semantic-graph, and LLM auto-generated summaries.

🔮 2. Vector Embeddings & Semantic Search Engine
- Use sentence-transformers (MiniLM, E5-small), HuggingFace local, or similar.
- Each node generates: vector_embedding.json, semantic_keywords, LLM_summary, intent_profile_tags.
- Implement /api/semantic/search?q=... and /api/semantic/similar?slug=...
- Plug-ready adapters for FAISS, ChromaDB, Qdrant, Pinecone, local disk.
- APIs must be plug-and-play for CLI, mobile, external AI agents.

🧠 3. Realtime Personalization Engine (User-Aware)
- Update user_intent_vector.json on all key actions (pageview, quiz, scroll, click, session, preference).
- Match user to top N content nodes, intent-matched offers, next quizzes/CTAs/neurons.
- Mutate recommendations and UI in real-time (sidebar, content, email/push, quiz redirect).

🔗 4. Intent Propagation + Auto-Mapping Logic
- New content auto-generates intent embedding + tags/links.
- Daily auto-graph-scan() for orphans, loops, underperformers.
- Update edge weights with analytics (CTR, dwell time, bounce).

📊 5. Admin Control Panel: /admin/semantic-graph
- D3.js/Cytoscape.js viz, node inspector, high-value path explorer, auto-suggestions, heatmaps, manual edge editing, vector debug tools.

🔐 6. API + Federation Hooks
- JWT + RBAC on all endpoints.
- Expose: GET/POST /api/semantic/{search,update-node,recommend,graph,path}
- Federation-aware: neurons can query, add, and fetch from the graph.
- APIs resilient, high-concurrency safe, with graceful error recovery and rate limits.

📘 7. README + Scaling Docs
- Auto-generate README_semantic.md with schema, API, scaling, sample payloads, federation guide.
- Include example scripts, exportable graph sample (.json), and curl docs.

🔁 Bonus: Auto-Audit + Self-Cleaning Logic
- Every 24h: flag low CTR nodes, orphans, unused segments, suggest LLM rewrites.

⚙️ Empire Rules:
- All new modules auto-register, full intent mapping, hybrid LLM→graph→vector→CTA recos.
- System must be ready for RAG, agent routing, Codex-AutoAuditor, GraphQL agent queries, RL training export.

💥 Output Requirements:
- No stubs, no demo-only, full working backend + modular admin panel.
- Ship with at least 20 varied sample nodes and a testable graph.
- All code modularized, export-ready, documented, and federation/AI slot compatible.
