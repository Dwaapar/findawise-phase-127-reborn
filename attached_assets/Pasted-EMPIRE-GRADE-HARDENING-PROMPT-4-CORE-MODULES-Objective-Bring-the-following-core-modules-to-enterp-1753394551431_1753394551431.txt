EMPIRE-GRADE HARDENING PROMPT (4 CORE MODULES)
Objective:
Bring the following core modules to enterprise/empire-grade level:
1. Dynamic Page Generator
2. Emotion Mapping Engine
3. Blog/Content Engine
4. ContentPointer Logic

Harden for scalability, security, modularity, AI-integration, and future feature expansion.

MANDATORY HARDENING STEPS:

1. Dynamic Page Generator

Enforce strict, type-safe schemas for all page props (title, description, layout, emotion, offer stack, modules, meta, A/B/C test variant, region, etc.)

Modular architecture: easy to add/remove modules per page (e.g., quizzes, lead magnets, tools, calculators, offer blocks)

Plug-and-play rendering: auto-detects which modules are needed per page and lazy-loads as needed

Handles localization, emotion themes, dynamic CTAs, and SEO fields

Page generator must support full SSR and SSG (static/dynamic generation) for max SEO + scale

API endpoints for: live preview, on-demand generation, export/import of pages, rollback

Security: sanitize all dynamic content before render, access-controlled endpoints

Logging: log each page generation event (when/who/what config), with rollback snapshot

Test suite: generate every page type and check for errors, empty states, missing modules, broken links, etc.

2. Emotion Mapping Engine

Strict type map for every supported emotion (e.g. trust, fear, excitement, curiosity, safety, urgency, etc.)

Each emotion has: color theme, tone/style, icon set, CTA logic, fallback if missing, custom animation/microinteraction hooks

Easy to extend: add new emotions or change mapping via config, no code edits needed

Supports A/B/C testing of emotion-driven design variants

Logs all changes/overrides per emotion

AI hooks: allows LLM to suggest/test emotion variants dynamically based on performance

All mappings are modular, reusable across pages, and localizable (multilingual emotion logic)

Full docs: mapping schema, how to extend, sample themes, how to connect to LLM/AI

3. Blog/Content Engine

Markdown/MDX + AI-generated content support (all major formats)

Modular content blocks: images, CTAs, quizzes, tables, affiliate links, lead magnets, video embeds, code samples

Content fetcher: dynamic load from /content, remote APIs, or external CMS if needed

Versioning: every edit tracked, revert/change logs, rollback available

Full-text search, category/tag filtering, smart pagination

Security: sanitize all content, block XSS/unsafe embeds, validate frontmatter/fields

AI hooks: allow auto-summarization, topic clustering, LLM-powered blog generation

Export/import: bulk upload, migration support, API endpoints for content CRUD

Test suite: render all blog types, stress-test with max length/complexity, validate all embeds/links

Docs: usage, extension, AI-integration, migration/rollback, schema, versioning, API

4. ContentPointer Logic

Every page/module/CTA/offer can reference any external content via ContentPointer (slug, URL, ID, etc.)

Supports all types: markdown, HTML, JSON, remote API, video, dynamic block, external tool, etc.

Validation: ensure content pointer is live, unbroken, and not duplicated

Caching: smart cache for external fetches, with TTL and cache-busting

Logs every content fetch: source, time, hit/miss, fallback if error

Admin UI: search all pointers, see broken/missing/duplicate pointers, fix/replace, audit history

Security: whitelist/blacklist allowed pointer domains/types

AI hooks: auto-update dead/broken pointers via LLM suggestion

Fully federated: other modules/neuron apps can use content pointers via API

Docs: pointer schema, usage patterns, error handling, extension guide

GENERAL FOR ALL MODULES:

All code must be modular, well-documented, and export-ready for federation

Security: sanitize all inputs/outputs, role-based access where needed

Logging: every major event (creation, update, error, rollback) with diff/rollback snapshots
