üìú CONSENT & COMPLIANCE ENGINE (Billion-Dollar Empire Grade, GDPR/CCPA/Global)

üéØ Objective  
Make the Findawise Empire 100% compliant with all modern privacy/consent requirements ‚Äî GDPR, CCPA, CPRA, ePrivacy, LGPD, and affiliate network policies. Users, affiliates, and regulators must trust you and you must pass all audits.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Consent Core

- **Consent Banner (Smart, Modular):**
  - Shows on first visit, geo-IP aware for required regions (EU/California/etc)
  - Allows granular opt-in/out (tracking, analytics, marketing, affiliate links)
  - Fully accessible, keyboard/tab friendly, and mobile-optimized
  - Remembers user choice in local storage, cookie, or DB (sync cross-device)
  - If rejected, disables all non-essential cookies/scripts

- **Consent Management UI:**
  - /privacy, /consent, or /settings page for users to review, change, or withdraw consent at any time
  - Option to export, erase, or request all personal data ("Erase Me" API)
  - Live log of consent history per user (who/when/what was toggled)

2Ô∏è‚É£ Policy Engine

- **Dynamic Privacy Policy & Terms:**
  - Auto-updates for each country, language, and partner requirement
  - Shows which services/APIs/cookies are used on each page
  - Versioned and timestamped for audit trail
  - Embedded affiliate disclosures and compliance copy for every offer/module

3Ô∏è‚É£ Consent & Data APIs

- `/api/consent/get` ‚Äî fetches current consent state for user
- `/api/consent/set` ‚Äî updates consent, logs change with timestamp/device/user
- `/api/consent/erase` ‚Äî triggers full data erasure (user/account/analytics/cookie/profile)
- `/api/consent/history` ‚Äî admin/audit log per user and globally

- **All APIs must be JWT/RBAC protected and fully logged.**

4Ô∏è‚É£ Cookie & Script Management

- **Script Loader:**  
  - Loads scripts (analytics, ads, chatbots, affiliate, A/B, etc) *only if* user has opted in.
  - No analytics/marketing loads before consent
  - Tag all scripts with data-consent attributes for easy toggle/disable

- **Affiliate Link Compliance:**  
  - Each affiliate offer/block must clearly disclose affiliate status
  - Option to disable all affiliate click tracking if user opts out
  - All click-tracking must respect consent state (no shadow tracking)

5Ô∏è‚É£ Geo-IP & Localization

- Detects user‚Äôs country/region and applies correct consent flow (GDPR, CCPA, none, or other)
- Auto-translates consent popups, privacy policies, and compliance banners
- Admin panel to override, simulate, or force region for testing

6Ô∏è‚É£ Admin/Legal Dashboard

- Real-time logs of all consent and privacy events
- Full list of ‚Äúerase me‚Äù requests, pending/complete
- Downloadable audit logs for legal reviews or network requests
- Versioning of every policy change, consent banner, and script loader

7Ô∏è‚É£ Hardened Security & Logging

- All changes to consent status, policies, or scripts logged with user/admin ID, time, and IP
- Tamper-proof logs, exportable for compliance
- Periodic compliance self-audit (runs weekly, flags issues, sends alerts)

8Ô∏è‚É£ README & Testing

- Full documentation: GDPR/CCPA logic, API, UI, data flow, all endpoints
- Test cases: every consent toggle, ‚Äúerase me,‚Äù multi-region, script loader, policy version, API call, affiliate opt-out
- Explain how to add new services/APIs for consent in the future

9Ô∏è‚É£ No Duplication, Only Hardening/Extension

- If consent logic exists, extend/harden ‚Äî do NOT create duplicates
- Upgrade any basic cookie/consent features to bulletproof enterprise grade
- Never allow ‚Äúconsent‚Äù to degrade to a single hardcoded popup

---

**DO THIS NOW. Output full UI, API, DB logic, logging, docs, tests, and integration.**  
*No shortcuts. No missing regions. No non-compliant affiliate/analytics/cookies. Full logs, full controls. If any feature is already present, upgrade/harden only ‚Äî never duplicate. The system must be impossible for Google, Amazon, or any legal team to break.*

---

When you run this, your empire will be **compliance-immune** and ready for global affiliate, SaaS, and user trust at *billion-dollar* scale.

**Ready for next, or want to go deeper into legal hardening or affiliate network policy specifics?**
