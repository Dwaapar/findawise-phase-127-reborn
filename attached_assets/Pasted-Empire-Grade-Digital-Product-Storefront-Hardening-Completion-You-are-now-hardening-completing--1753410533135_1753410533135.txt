Empire-Grade Digital Product Storefront Hardening + Completion
“You are now hardening, completing, and empire-grading the Digital Product Storefront and all related monetization modules. Your goal: Create a billion-dollar, production-ready e-commerce engine for digital products.

1. Product Storefront (Frontend + Backend)
Dynamic Product Config: Products, categories, tags, pricing, inventory (JSON/db, easily editable)

Product Display: Rich cards, ratings, feature badges, testimonials, reviews, “what’s included” section

Smart Search & Filtering: By name, tag, price, category, trending, best-seller

Dynamic Offers: Limited-time deals, bundles, cross-sells, up-sells

Cart System: Add/remove/edit, view details, price breakdown, offer logic, discount code support

Responsive, Accessible: Mobile-first UI, full accessibility, WAVE/ADA compliant

2. Checkout & Payment Engine
Payment Providers: Integrate Stripe (or Paddle, Razorpay, PayPal if regionally better), with fallback/test mode

License Generation: For each purchase, auto-generate license/coupon codes (configurable), send via email/download

Invoice/Receipt: Auto-email PDF invoice/receipt, in-dashboard order history

Guest + Registered Checkout: Both supported, with “download as guest” flow

Order Tracking: Show status, allow re-download/resend of purchase

Compliance: VAT/Tax calculations, GDPR, data privacy notices, refund policy

3. Digital Delivery Engine
Download Manager: After purchase, user gets a secure download link (expiring, one-time, or dashboard-based)

Content Types: E-books, PDFs, courses, software, plug-ins, membership, gated content

License Keys: If product needs it, key is delivered securely and stored in user dashboard

Resend/Restore: User can request re-download, lost keys, etc.

4. Admin Control Panel
Product CRUD: Add/edit/remove products, offers, licenses

Order Management: View/export all orders, status, issues

Stats Dashboard: Revenue, sales per product, conversion rates, best/worst-sellers

CSV Export: Download all sales/orders/analytics for accounting

5. Analytics & Integrations
Track: Product views, add-to-cart, purchases, refunds, bounce/abandon, coupon usage, top upsells

Integrate: All events with core analytics/statistics engine (see prior module)

Dashboard: Visual charts for all key metrics

6. Harden & Upgrade Previous Partials
Auto-audit all previously built storefront/checkout/license/payment/delivery code

Finish and upgrade any feature that was only partially implemented

Upgrade:

Cart logic

Payment handling (test, fail, multi-currency, tax)

Digital file security

License code generator (random, unique, tamper-proof)

Full compliance (GDPR, refunds, email templates)

7. Documentation (README.md)
Full instructions: Adding products, payment setup, license management, delivery config

API docs: Endpoints, webhooks, sample JSON

Troubleshooting: Payments, delivery, customer support flows

8. Final Output Requirements
No stubs, no placeholders, no TODOs.

All modules exportable/importable.

Empire-level production quality.

All critical logic and UI present.

Self-audit: Confirm every core requirement above is completed, nothing partial remains.

Build as if you are Stripe, Gumroad, and Shopify combined for digital products.

Once done, output the full README and self-audit checklist.

Do not compress code or skip modules. This is a handoff to a billion-dollar empire.
