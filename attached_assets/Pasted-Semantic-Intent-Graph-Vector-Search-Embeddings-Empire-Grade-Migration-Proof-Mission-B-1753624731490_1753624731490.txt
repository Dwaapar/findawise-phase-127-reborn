Semantic Intent Graph + Vector Search & Embeddings (Empire Grade, Migration-Proof)

ðŸŽ¯ Mission:
Build a semantic intelligence engine that deeply understands every page, quiz, offer, product, user, and journey across the empire â€” and evolves through user activity, content updates, and AI-driven mapping.  
This system must work seamlessly through any DB migration, be modular, and be able to plug into any backend (Postgres, Supabase, Neo4j, ChromaDB, Pinecone, Qdrant, etc.).

**1. Graph & Schema Setup**
- Modular schema: 
    - Nodes: page, quiz, offer, cta, user, blog, neuron, session, archetype
    - Edges: related_to, solves, leads_to, matches_intent, triggered_by, journey_path
- Each node/edge has: id, type, slug, meta, created, lastUpdated, embeddings, metrics (CTR, conversions, rank)
- All schema/config lives in central config files or DB, never hardcoded.
- *If DB not present*, auto-generate mock/data stubs, but build code to auto-adapt/upgrade if DB is later added or schema is changed.

**2. Vector Embeddings Engine**
- Integrate sentence-transformers (MiniLM, bge-small, all-MiniLM-L6-v2, etc.)
- For each node, generate and store embedding vectors
- Vector DB: ChromaDB, Supabase vector extension, Pinecone, Qdrant, or in-memory fallback (auto-adapt to available backend)
- All embeddings auto-backup and can migrate/restore on DB migration

**3. Intent Search & Recommendations**
- `/api/semantic/search?q=`: returns most relevant pages, offers, CTAs, quizzes, products, etc. (vector similarity)
- `/api/semantic/similar?slug=`: get semantically similar nodes
- Always fetch config/schema from DB/config, never hardcoded, always auto-heal after DB migration

**4. Real-Time Auto-Mapping Logic**
- On new content/user action: auto-add node, auto-create intent edges, recalculate embeddings, sync to DB
- On migration/restore: auto-rescan all nodes/edges, regenerate embeddings, remap intent clusters

**5. Personalization & UX**
- Track each userâ€™s journey vector, match them to intent clusters, auto-personalize page/offers/content
- All mappings/data are stored centrally and can sync/restore on DB migration

**6. Admin UI:**
- `/admin/semantic-graph`
    - Graph visualizer (D3.js/Cytoscape.js)
    - Node/edge explorer, embedding similarity view
    - Migration/backup/restore tools
    - Manual override for connections and embeddings

**7. API & Security**
- All endpoints secured via JWT/RBAC
- Role-based admin for graph editing
- All schema changes/versioning tracked and rollback-able (for migration recovery)

**8. Docs & Output**
- README_semantic.md with:
    - Schema diagrams, migration notes, recovery best practices
    - How system self-recovers after DB move/restore
    - Full API examples, admin usage, scaling guides

**9. Rules**
- No hardcoded DB endpoints/config; all dynamic, pulled from env/config/DB.
- All storage/adapters must auto-migrate and recover
- If DB is missing, auto-stub/fallback; if added later, system migrates/imports old data
- Every update/change logged
- Do not duplicate logic, always upgrade/merge.
- Output ALL code, docs, and admin changes.

Make all database schemas robust, tables, and logic fully self-healing, migration-immune, and bootstrappable.
If DB is missing, empty, or new: auto-create schema, indexes, constraints, default config.
Pull all credentials (Supabase, etc.) only from .env â€” no hardcode ever.
No direct SQL in UI â€” all logic flows through hardened service/API layer.
Add init checks: validate schema health, retry on fail, show admin alerts if broken.
System must behave as if nothing broke â€” even if DB was replaced 1 minute ago.
Resilience must match billion-dollar SaaS. No placeholders. No assumptions.
Ensure this module includes a fully provisioned, elite-grade, resilient database schema.
All tables, indexes, constraints, relationships, and API endpoints must be:
Migration-proof (works seamlessly across Replit accounts or environments)
Supabase-compatible (or any Postgres DB)
Auto-restoring (self-healing on project reboots or migrations)
Exportable & Documented (with schema diagrams + queries)





**DO THIS NOW.**  
Make the Semantic Intent Graph the intelligent, migration-proof, central intelligence engine for the empire.
