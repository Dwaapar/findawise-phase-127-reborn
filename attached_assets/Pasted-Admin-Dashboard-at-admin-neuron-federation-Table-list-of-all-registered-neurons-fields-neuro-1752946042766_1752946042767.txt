Admin Dashboard (at /admin/neuron-federation)

Table/list of all registered neurons (fields: neuron name, status, last check-in, health, current config version, main page link, analytics summary)

Buttons to deploy, update config, retire, or clone a neuron

“Add neuron” wizard: guide for registering a new micro-app

Real-time update indicator for each neuron

Federation APIs

/api/neuron/register — Neuron registers itself here (POST: {name, URL, type, supported features})

/api/neuron/status — Neuron sends regular heartbeat here (POST: {neuronId, status, stats, uptime})

/api/neuron/update-config — Core pushes config/experiment updates to neurons (POST: {neuronId, newConfig})

/api/analytics/report — Neurons POST analytics/events here (POST: {neuronId, eventType, data})

All endpoints must be documented in README with example requests

Central Config, Orchestrator, Analytics

Store global empire config (config.json or config table)

All neuron configs are stored and versioned in /configs/neuron-configs/

Orchestrator logic and analytics reporting (just placeholders/stubs in v1)

Every config change and API call must be logged (for rollback/audit)

Security & Session

Session and API keys for neuron authentication (JWT/token)

Only registered/verified neurons can call APIs or be managed in dashboard

README.md

Must fully document setup, federation API, how to register a neuron, how to monitor/control, and how to add new features

Step-by-step guide with example neuron registration and config update flow

Explain file/folder structure for configs, logs, and federation logic

Optional (if possible):
WebSocket/event-based push for real-time config propagation (in addition to REST)

CLI script to bootstrap/register new neurons

Sample “mock” neuron for quick local testing

Rules:
All logic must be modular, exportable, and ready for future scale (100+ neurons)

Never hardcode; use config and enums everywhere

Code must be clean, commented, and ready for team handoff

No skipped steps or half-baked logic—this is a production control tower for an empire
Build the findawise-core federation brain as described above.
Output full code and an English README.md.
This will be the root for the next Neuron modules.
