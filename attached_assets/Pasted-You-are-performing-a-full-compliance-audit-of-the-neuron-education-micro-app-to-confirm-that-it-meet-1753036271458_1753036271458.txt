You are performing a full compliance audit of the neuron-education micro-app to confirm that it meets all federation, AI, modularity, analytics, and monetization requirements specified in the neuron prompt.

Check and confirm that each of the following is fully implemented and functional:

🔁 Federation Protocols
 /api/neuron/register fires on boot with proper metadata

 /api/neuron/status sends heartbeat every 60s with uptime, health, and usage

 /api/neuron/update-config hot-loads config, experiments, themes, scaling rules

 /api/analytics/report logs every quiz, click, scroll, session, offer interaction

 All routes secured with API token via .env

🧩 Core Modules
 QuizEngine.tsx — quiz flow, result logic, scoring, redirect to personalized offers

 ConfigSync.ts — pulls latest config from orchestrator and hot-applies it

 AnalyticsClient.ts — emits frontend + backend analytics events to Empire Core

 ContentFetcher.ts — scrapes or pulls blog/tutorial content dynamically

 OfferLoader.ts — loads dynamic or config-based affiliate offers

 ArchetypeEngine.ts — segments users into types and adapts UI/UX

 AIAssistant.tsx — functional AI tutor embedded on key pages

🧠 AI Personalization & Evolution
 A/B testing engine for layout, offer order, CTA logic

 LLM-powered tutor is working and routes questions by category

 Auto content generation is active and storing .md or .json content

 Underperformance rollback logic works (detects high bounce/low CTR and reverts)

 Config is updated via orchestrator dynamically (not hardcoded)

🧱 Content Structure
 Offers stored in offers.json or loaded via config/API

 Articles in content/articles/*.md or MDX (not hardcoded)

 Tools live in tools/ and are modular (e.g., course finder, timers)

 Quizzes defined in quizzes/config.json and handled by QuizEngine.tsx

🔐 Affiliate Logic
 All affiliate URLs are cloaked via /redirect?offer=xyz

 Clicks tracked via /api/analytics/report

 Auto-rotation logic based on CTR or payout works correctly

🎓 Niche Content Implementation
 100+ SEO articles/blogs added or available via auto-import

 Product stack includes at least: Coursera, Udemy, Skillshare, Language tools

 Lead magnets (eBooks, planners, checklists) are downloadable or gated

 Quizzes like “What’s Your Study Style?” are functional and personalized

🎨 Emotion-Mapped UI Modes
 Empower (career-focused theme)

 Curious (discovery-driven layout)

 Disciplined (minimal exam-style UX)

 Theme switches based on archetype or session data

🎮 Gamification Systems
 XP and streak tracker implemented

 Leaderboards (even if basic/local)

 Brain quests system works (multi-task daily goals)

 Rewards engine functions for unlocking discounts/guides

🧾 Export / Import
 Config is exportable to .neuron.json

 Content, offers, quizzes can be re-imported via /api/neuron/load-config or local load

📈 Analytics & Auto-Healing
 Scrolls, clicks, time-on-page, quiz results are tracked

 Self-healing logic works:

 CTR drop triggers rollback

 API failure detection

 Slow LCP detection and flag

 Thresholds configurable via update-config

📚 README.md & REPLIT.md
 README and REPLIT.md were updated (not duplicated)

 Docs include:

 Setup instructions

 Federation logic

 Scaling guide (e.g., neuron-testprep)

 AI architecture map

 Config/offer/article import logic

🧪 Final Verifications
 No hardcoded URLs, tokens, content, or offers

 All logic controlled via .env, config.json, offers.json, quizzes/*.json

 All modules are pluggable, trackable, and compliant with Empire standard
