Codex Auto-Audit & Self-Improvement Engine (Empire-Grade, AI-Powered, Self-Healing)

🎯 Objective:
Build a continuous, AI-driven audit and improvement layer that:
- Automatically reviews code, config, content, offers, funnels, UX, SEO, analytics, security, and compliance
- Flags issues, proposes and can apply fixes, and documents all changes for empire-wide improvement

---

🔩 1. LLM Audit & Assistant Layer
- Integrate with open-source LLMs (OpenRouter, Ollama, Local, GPT-4/Claude if available)
- Schedule continuous or on-demand audits:
    - Code (JS/TS, React, API, service logic)
    - Content (blog, offer copy, CTA, metadata)
    - SEO (titles, meta, schema, performance)
    - Security (JWT, storage, API, consent)
    - Analytics (conversion events, missing tracking, A/B coverage)
- Run as CLI, API endpoint, or via /admin/codex-audit-dashboard

---

⚡️ 2. Smart Self-Healing & Patch Engine
- When issues are detected:
    - Propose fixes in context (show diff, patch, recommended next action)
    - For low-risk issues, auto-apply patch (AI-powered PR/commit)
    - High-risk: queue for human review with detailed recommendation
- All fixes/patches logged and versioned (auto-commit history, undo/rollback)

---

🧠 3. Evolution & Learning Loop
- As issues recur or are patched, LLM learns:
    - Patterns of code/config/UX/content issues by neuron, vertical, or template
    - Prioritizes fixes for “repeat offenders”
    - Suggests prevention (lint rules, config guards, better templates)
- Self-generates “improvement tasks” for backlog
- Summarizes weekly/monthly “empire evolution” progress (auto-changelog, leaderboard)

---

📊 4. Admin Dashboard & API
- /admin/codex-audit-dashboard:
    - Run audit, view results by category (code, content, SEO, UX, security, compliance)
    - Approve/deny patches, view audit logs, roll back/undo, assign tasks
    - Visualize: top issues, trends, performance improvement, code coverage
- Expose API for all neurons/modules to submit for audit or pull suggestions

---

🔐 5. Security, Compliance & RBAC
- All audit/patch actions RBAC + JWT protected
- Auto-audit: consent, cookies, GDPR, CCPA, affiliate disclosure
- Red/Amber/Green “production readiness” traffic light per neuron/module

---

📘 6. README (MANDATORY)
- Full usage docs: audit scheduling, patching, rollback, integration with LLMs, security, scaling
- Sample audit reports, config diffs, patch scripts, admin workflow

---

💥 Output Requirements:
- Live, testable audit system
- All code/config/content actually scanned and improved (no fake stubs)
- Modular, exportable, AI-ready, versioned
- Export: backend, frontend dashboard, audit logs, README, example PRs/patches
