Phase 3: Federation Glue (Real-Time Sync & Control).

First:
This phase is the “central nervous system” — it’s not as repetitive as neuron deployment, but it IS complex.
I’ll break it into two tactical phases (so you don’t get overwhelmed or blocked):

Phase 3A: Core Federation Dashboard & Real-Time Sync
GOAL:
Build the /admin/neuron-federation dashboard and the core event/config pipeline so you can see, control, and update ALL neurons from one place in real time.

YOUR PROMPT (Ready for Replit, copy-paste):
Phase 3A: Federation Glue — Central Dashboard & Real-Time Sync

Objective:
Build the core admin dashboard at /admin/neuron-federation in the findawise-core repo.
Integrate real-time neuron monitoring, config push, status, and analytics.

Requirements:
Dashboard UI

List all registered neurons (from DB/API), with status (heartbeat/last seen/health/vertical).

Show key stats: online/offline, config version, analytics summary (traffic, conversions, errors, MRR/revenue if available).

“Live view” table with status refresh every 5s.

Neuron Controls

For each neuron:

Hot-push new config, experiment, or orchestrator command (manual, file upload, or GUI editor).

Deploy/retire/clone neuron (sets DB/API status, triggers webhook/CLI for auto-provisioning in later phase).

View neuron logs/errors inline.

“Global” controls: Push experiment/config/AI updates to ALL neurons.

Real-Time Sync/Push

Support real-time config/experiment push (websockets preferred, fallback to REST if needed).

Neurons must instantly apply changes, respond with success/error, and update status in core.

Analytics/Event Feed

Pull analytics/events from all neurons, show per-neuron and empire-wide charts (visitors, CTR, leads, revenue, experiment stats, errors, etc).

Drill-down to neuron details or export CSV for any metric/event.

Audit/History

Log all config pushes, experiment changes, and status transitions.

Rollback/undo last config for any neuron (keep at least last 10 states).

Security

Protect dashboard and APIs with role-based access (JWT, API key, or admin login).

Audit log for all admin actions.

Docs

Auto-generate README.md (“Federation Glue Phase”), with full usage, architecture, API, error handling, and scaling guide.

Rules:

Must be production-grade, no demo logic.

All APIs/UI must be modular, tested, and exportable for the next phase.

No hardcoded neurons—100% dynamic, real DB/API integration.

If CLI/auto-provision is not possible in this phase, stub it (build in Phase 5).

DELIVERABLES:

/admin/neuron-federation dashboard (React/Next.js preferred, but any scalable UI stack)

Updated core backend (DB/models/events/config/api)

All code, UI, and logic in exportable modules
