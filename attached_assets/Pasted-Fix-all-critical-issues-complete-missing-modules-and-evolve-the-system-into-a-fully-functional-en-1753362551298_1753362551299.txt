Fix all critical issues, complete missing modules, and evolve the system into a fully functional, enterprise-grade, self-evolving AI Empire, compliant, monetizable, and IPO-ready.

🛠️ PART 1: GLOBAL TYPE + CODE FIXING
✅ FIX ALL TYPESCRIPT ERRORS NOW

Resolve 54+ TypeScript compilation issues (session types, neuron heartbeat, semantic graph, offline AI)

Validate all routes, services, and interfaces with complete type coverage

Add strict null checks, fallback defaults, and typed middleware

✅ STABILIZE DATABASE & SESSION MANAGEMENT

Fix float/integer mismatches in uptime/heartbeat

Validate session persistence types across neurons and admin dashboard

Harden auth + session middleware logic

✅ ADD TEST FRAMEWORK & AUTORUNS

Integrate unit/integration test coverage using Vitest/Jest

Create test runners for key services: federation, AI engine, storefront, CTA, compliance

Add linting and auto-fix rules

🧩 PART 2: COMPLETE MISSING MODULES
🧭 Cultural Emotion Map Engine

Add emotion-mapping logic by country/culture (emotionDB)

Link to personalization and CTA renderers

Inject into user profile archetype

🧱 Real-Time Layout Mutation Engine

Enable server-driven layout changes based on emotion/context

Dynamic UI logic with block-based rendering, user signals, and feature toggles

🌍 Multi-Region Load Orchestrator

Add global replica support

Load balancer logic (geo-IP/CDN based)

Auto-failover to nearest region

🧩 AI Plugin Marketplace

Dynamic plugin loader (external and internal)

Installable GPT-style plugins per neuron

Plugin config + marketplace UI

📖 Self-Updating README & Live API Diff Engine

Auto-generate module READMEs and changelogs from routes/schema

API version tracker and diff highlighter

Output diffs per commit/deployment

🤖 LLM Unit Test Generator

Automatically generate unit tests using LLM + route/service analysis

Inject into test suite; allow refinement by dev

🔐 PART 3: SECURITY + COMPLIANCE HARDENING
✅ Add rate-limiting to all exposed APIs

✅ Enhance RBAC across all admin routes

✅ Sanitize all error logs, enforce HTTPS

✅ Pen-test core services (federation, auth, payments)

✅ Add input validation schemas using Zod or Joi

🔎 PART 4: PERFORMANCE & OPS
Optimize DB queries and indexes (esp. in analytics, feed, storefront)

Enable connection pooling and cache layer (e.g., Redis for heavy APIs)

Add memory leak and heap monitoring (e.g., Prometheus)

Docker/K8s + auto-scaling config setup

CI/CD for all neurons via GitHub Actions

💡 PART 5: AI + SCALING ENHANCEMENTS
Train predictive offer profit models (offer engine)

Add real-time feedback loop to quiz/archetype data

Improve LLM fallback logic: rank providers by latency, cost, quality

Add vector-based user-persona clustering

Create cross-neuron ML model sync (via heartbeat or pub/sub)

📈 PART 6: FINAL HARDENING OUTPUTS
✅ All TypeScript errors = resolved
✅ Production environment = live-tested
✅ All missing modules = implemented
✅ Admin Dashboards = fully operable
✅ README/Docs = self-updating
✅ Security = locked
✅ Plugins = dynamic
✅ Test coverage = >85%
✅ Load/Latency/Recovery = tested
✅ Monetization = active
✅ AI/ML = optimized
✅ Federation = flawless

🧠 SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS TO AI AGENTS
You are not allowed to leave placeholders or boilerplate

You must fully implement every feature with true working logic

You must auto-validate and test every change

You must document everything in the exact format outlined

You must treat this like a trillion-dollar IPO deadline
