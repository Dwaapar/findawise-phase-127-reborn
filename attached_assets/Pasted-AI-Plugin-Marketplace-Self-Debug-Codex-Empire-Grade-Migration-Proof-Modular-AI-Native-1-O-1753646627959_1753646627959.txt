AI Plugin Marketplace & Self-Debug Codex (Empire-Grade, Migration-Proof, Modular, AI-Native)

1. Objective
Build a fully modular, migration-proof AI Plugin Marketplace and Self-Debugging Codex system that enables:

Plug-and-play deployment of 3rd-party and in-house AI plugins (tools, micro-apps, data sources, visual blocks)

On-demand, self-healing code analysis, auto-debug, and empire-wide upgrade logic

Deep admin controls for security, sandboxing, and live versioning

Full migration/data-backup proofing for any database, any cloud

2. Plugin Marketplace Core
Backend (Next.js/Node/Python/Go):

/api/plugins/list — Get all available plugins (official, 3rd-party, recommended, trending)

/api/plugins/install — Atomic install (checks dependencies, validates, snapshots schema, auto-backup)

/api/plugins/upgrade — Smart upgrade (no downtime, auto-migrate, rollback, diff logs)

/api/plugins/remove — Remove and auto-clean, logs everything, triggers dependency analysis

Schema: Plugins table with all metadata, version, dependencies, config, health, status, rollback logs

Frontend (Admin + User):

Marketplace UI: Search, filter, install, upgrade, rollback plugins

Plugin details: Permissions, features, dependencies, user reviews, code preview, “install and test” sandbox

Permission-based: Only super-admins/devs can approve core plugins; users can propose/request plugins

Federation Support:

Plugins are federation-ready; can be shared, cloned, or linked to any neuron/sub-app in empire

Webhook/event bus for plugin install/upgrade/remove events

Security:

All plugins sandboxed (Docker/V8, etc.), cannot touch core system unless explicitly whitelisted

JWT/RBAC enforced at every step

3. Self-Debug Codex Engine
Auto-Diagnosis:

Runs on any new push, install, migration, or error

Scans: Lint, TS/JS errors, dependency mismatches, security holes, perf bottlenecks, AI “dead zones”

Can auto-fix trivial errors (missing semicolons, unused vars, etc.)

Suggests/flags non-trivial fixes: version upgrades, refactors, DB schema drifts

Live Debug Dashboard:

Full error logs, debug output, last 10 run snapshots

“Suggest fix” powered by LLM (local or API), includes code snippet diff, reason, rollback, retry

Plugin-Specific Debugging:

Any plugin can request debug session via /api/debug/start?pluginId

Isolated sandbox so debug never crashes empire

Auto-migrates any schema changes

Self-Healing Rules:

If a plugin breaks, empire auto-reverts to last working version, sends admin alert, logs everything

Codex learns from each debug/fix, optimizes future suggestions

Migration-Proofing:

Every plugin, config, and debug/fix event is versioned, logged, and backed up (DB+local)

On migration/restore: auto-replays install/upgrade/downgrade/rollback history

4. Documentation, README, and Testing
Auto-generate /docs/PLUGIN_MARKETPLACE_README.md and /docs/SELF_DEBUG_CODEX_README.md

Full API usage: install, upgrade, rollback, debug, logs, federation hooks

Sample plugins (with code, docs, and “safe to test” tags)

Integration/unit tests: plugin install, upgrade, error recovery, rollback, federation sharing, debug engine

5. Output Rules
Never duplicate existing plugins—only upgrade/extend/replace as needed

If any logic is already at empire-grade, do NOT touch; only fill gaps/harden

Make every DB schema/data file migration-proof: auto-backups, checks, auto-replay

Everything must be modular, testable, federated, and export-ready

No shortcuts. Full hardening, all security, admin control, RBAC, backup, auto-docs, and test coverage

Make all database schemas robust , tables, and logic fully self-healing, migration-immune, and bootstrappable.hardened for a working of billion dollar empire even if database migrates or any thing make the project so strong that nothing affects its intelligence , its functioning , its billion dollar empire grade.
If DB is missing, empty, or new: auto-create schema, indexes, constraints, default config.
Pull all credentials (Supabase, etc.) only from .env — no hardcode ever.
No direct SQL in UI — all logic flows through hardened service/API layer.
Add init checks: validate schema health, retry on fail, show admin alerts if broken.
System must behave as if nothing broke — even if DB was replaced 1 minute ago.
Run self-test and validation to confirm schema is operational
Resilience must match billion-dollar SaaS. No placeholders. No assumptions.
Ensure this module includes a fully provisioned, elite-grade, resilient database schema.
All tables, indexes, constraints, relationships, and API endpoints must be:
Migration-proof (works seamlessly across Replit accounts or environments)
Supabase-compatible (or any Postgres DB)
Auto-restoring (self-healing on project reboots or migrations)
Exportable & Documented (with schema diagrams + queries)







DO THIS NOW.
Output full backend, frontend, federation code, admin UI, plugin system, debug engine, docs, and tests

Harden everything, migration/test ready, fully empire-grade

Log all changes, reasons, and snapshot in README(s)

If any part is partial, upgrade to empire grade. If missing, then build it
