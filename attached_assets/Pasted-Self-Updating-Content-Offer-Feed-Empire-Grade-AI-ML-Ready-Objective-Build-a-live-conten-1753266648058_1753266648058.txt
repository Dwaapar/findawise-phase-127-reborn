Self-Updating Content & Offer Feed (Empire-Grade, AI/ML-Ready)

🎯 Objective:
Build a live content/offer ingestion and update engine that:
- Pulls offers, deals, blog content, reviews, and product data from 3rd-party APIs (Amazon PA, CJ, Awin, SaaS, partner feeds)
- Auto-updates the empire’s site/app with latest prices, availability, coupons, ratings, etc.
- Cleans, deduplicates, and ranks data for each niche/neuron
- Supports manual override and LLM-powered enrichment

---

🔩 1. Affiliate/API Ingestion Layer
- Modular “connector” system for:
    - Amazon Product Advertising API (official)
    - CJ Affiliate, Rakuten, Awin, Partnerize, Impact, SaaS feeds (REST, GraphQL, XML, CSV, Scraping)
    - News/blog/article feeds (RSS, API, web scraper)
- Each connector handles:
    - Auth, rate limiting, error/retry, logging
    - Normalizes all data to master Offer/Content schema
- Pluggable for new networks/APIs at any time

---

⚡️ 2. Auto-Refresh & Change Detection
- Scheduled polling (cron, on-demand, webhook) — fetches latest data per vertical/niche
- Detects new, updated, or expired offers/content
- Removes/flags expired or out-of-stock items instantly
- Auto-notifies admin + triggers in-app/push/email alerts for major changes

---

🧠 3. Content/Offer Enrichment & Ranking
- Auto-enriches data:
    - LLM auto-generates descriptions, review blurbs, FAQ, comparison bullets, SEO meta
    - Scrapes/reviews ratings, price drops, trending tags
    - Flags “low quality” or duplicate offers/content
- Ranks/filters by performance (CTR, conversion, AI/ML score), freshness, compliance

---

📈 4. Live Rendering & Federation
- Dynamically injects latest offers/content into relevant pages/neurons via federation API/config sync
- Real-time update hooks for blog, offer, comparison, and product pages
- Supports per-user personalization (offer stack adapts to user intent/quiz/segment/archetype)

---

🔗 5. Admin Dashboard & Manual Control
- /admin/offer-feed-dashboard:
    - View/import/override all offers/content per vertical/niche
    - Manual curation/priority/banlist
    - Trigger refresh, roll back, see update logs, API status, change diffs
    - Export feed data for analytics, compliance, partners

---

🔐 6. Compliance, Security & Error Handling
- All API keys/tokens stored in env vars/secrets, never hardcoded
- GDPR/CCPA: remove on request, purge data, consent for personalized offers
- Rate limiting, exponential backoff, and monitoring of all external API calls

---

📘 7. README (MANDATORY)
- Full docs: connecting APIs, scheduling refresh, manual overrides, analytics, export/import, error handling, scaling
- Sample connector code, data schema, logs

---

💥 Output Requirements:
- Live, testable API connectors, update logic, admin UI, federation hooks, logs, README
- No stubs, no “example-only”—real working ingestion and refresh for at least 1 affiliate API and 1 content feed
- Modular, scalable, auto-export/import for new verticals
