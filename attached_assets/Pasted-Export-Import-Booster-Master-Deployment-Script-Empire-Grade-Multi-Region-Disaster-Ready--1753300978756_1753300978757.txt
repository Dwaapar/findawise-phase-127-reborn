Export/Import Booster + Master Deployment Script (Empire-Grade, Multi-Region, Disaster-Ready)

üéØ Objective:
Build an export/import and deployment system that enables full backup, cloning, migration, and rapid deployment of the entire Findawise Empire stack‚Äîcore, all neurons, config, content, analytics, AI models, assets, and docs.

---

üî© 1. Modular Export/Import Booster
- One-click export/import for:
    - Neurons (UI, API-only, ML, data, etc.)
    - Core config (JSON, TS, DB dump)
    - Offers, affiliate links, products, content
    - User profiles, analytics, session data
    - AI models/weights, logs, changelogs, and docs
- Export as tar/zip (with manifest.json + checksums)
- Import: auto-validates, maps, and merges with current empire (skip, overwrite, merge, dry run)
- Version-aware‚Äîhandles schema upgrades, new modules, dependency checks

---

‚ö°Ô∏è 2. Master Deployment Script/CLI
- `empire-deploy` CLI or shell script:
    - Deploys core, all neurons, and DB in parallel (docker-compose, k8s, or pnpm scripts)
    - Loads config, assets, offers, and dependencies
    - Environment templating: staging, prod, dev, multi-region
    - Auto-run migration/seed scripts and pre/post hooks
    - Health checks, error logging, rollback/undo
- GUI: /admin/deployment-dashboard (view status, logs, history, version, trigger deploys/rollbacks)

---

üìà 3. Scaling, Disaster Recovery & Rollback
- Auto-scheduled empire-wide backups (cloud, S3, local)
- Rapid restore of empire (any or all modules)
- Logs every deployment, import, export, rollback, with diff/audit trail

---

üîê 4. Security, Compliance & RBAC
- All exports/imports secured by JWT, RBAC, API key
- Data encrypted at rest/in transit
- Audit trail for every action, backup, deploy

---

üìò 5. README (MANDATORY)
- Full docs: export/import flows, CLI usage, deployment, backup/restore, disaster recovery, migration, multi-region, scaling, RBAC
- Sample config, deployment logs, backup archive, manifest, checksums

---

üí• Output Requirements:
- Working export/import booster (backend + admin UI), master deploy CLI, logs, RBAC, README, sample archives
- Test export/import/deploy with at least 1 neuron, core, and analytics module
