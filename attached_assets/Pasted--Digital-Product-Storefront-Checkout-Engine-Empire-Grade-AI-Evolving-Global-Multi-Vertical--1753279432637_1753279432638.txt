 Digital Product Storefront & Checkout Engine (Empire-Grade, AI-Evolving, Global, Multi-Vertical)
🎯 Objective:
Build a fully modular, AI-personalized, auto-scaling storefront engine to sell and deliver unlimited digital products (eBooks, SaaS, tools, courses, memberships) alongside affiliate offers — with self-evolving intelligence, real-time analytics, partner revenue logic, and global compliance.

🛒 1. Storefront Engine (Frontend + Personalization)
Host unlimited digital products: eBooks, courses, tools, SaaS, webinars, templates, premium content

Product config: pricing, media, tags, upsells, reviews, licenses, SEO

Personalization layer: recommend products based on user behavior, quiz result, segment, emotion graph

Smart product blocks: reusable blocks for dynamic carousels, bundles, recommendations

Offer stack: show own + affiliate offers contextually (auto-rank via AI intent & payout mapping)

Full PWA/mobile responsiveness, light/dark theme switch, SEO meta builder

⚡️ 2. Checkout & Payment Logic (Global)
Stripe default; plug-ins for Razorpay, PayPal, Paddle, Gumroad, UPI, Google Pay, crypto

Multi-currency, global taxes (VAT/GST/US sales tax), receipts, invoices

Promo code engine, one-click upsell/downsell, exit-intent offers, order bumps

Cart abandonment detection → trigger recovery email/push funnel

AI pricing optimizer: suggests ideal price points per country or segment

📦 3. Delivery & Access Engine
Automatic digital delivery: gated content, link, download, SaaS activation

License key gen + usage logs + revoke/reissue system

Drip content unlock (e.g., day 1, day 3, after X steps)

Premium lock system for content inside blog/funnel/app

Anti-fraud: fingerprinting, time lock, IP lock, abuse detection

Real-time usage analytics: time spent, engagement score, drop-off

💸 4. Affiliate, Partner & Revenue Share System
Revenue split logic: split payments to creators, resellers, marketers

Partner dashboard: commissions, tracking links, UTM, payout logs

Cross-federation support: allow 3rd party creators to sell via this store

Bonus: LLM explains commissions to partners in natural language

📈 5. Analytics, Optimization & Export
Track: sales, refund rate, LTV, best-sellers, funnel ROI, abandonment, upsell flow success

Visual analytics dashboard (heatmaps, journey flow, geo map, product graph)

A/B/N test: pricing, offer stack, CTA design, delivery sequence

All analytics exportable (CSV/JSON) for AI training or external warehouse

Poor performers to remove or improve

PCI-DSS compliant payments, GDPR/CCPA/KYC-ready

Double opt-in, license terms display, refund policy enforcement

Support inbox: tickets, FAQ bot, live chat + AI copilot
