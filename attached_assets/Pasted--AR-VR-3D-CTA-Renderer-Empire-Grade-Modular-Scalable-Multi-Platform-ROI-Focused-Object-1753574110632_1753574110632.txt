üßä AR/VR/3D CTA Renderer (Empire Grade, Modular, Scalable, Multi-Platform, ROI-Focused)

üéØ Objective
Deliver a real-time, interactive CTA rendering engine capable of embedding calls-to-action (offers, quizzes, lead magnets, upsells, product previews) as immersive 3D/AR/VR components‚Äîmaximizing conversion through experience, not just copy or design.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Core System & Tech Stack
- **Choose stack based on current empire tech (React Three Fiber, Babylon.js, or A-Frame for web; Unity bridge for native, AR.js/8thWall for mobile AR, WebXR API for VR)**
- **Fully modular engine**: All CTAs/components defined via JSON/config and importable into any 3D/AR/VR context
- **Supports both web-based (browser, PWA) and native (iOS/Android, future headsets) delivery**

2Ô∏è‚É£ CTA Types & Logic
- **Supported CTA formats:**
  - Interactive 3D buttons, floating badges, animated product demos, spinning lead magnet cubes, AR product placement (drag/resize in real room), VR/3D guided quizzes, click-to-unlock bonuses, environment-reactive offers (e.g., CTA glows when user focuses on product)
- **Dynamic content mapping:** Each CTA‚Äôs style/animation/offer is linked to the page/niche/emotion/context
- **Real-time triggers:** Appear on scroll, gaze, gesture, completion of quiz, voice command, or context (geo, time, AR marker)

3Ô∏è‚É£ UI/UX & Experience
- **Mobile-first and headset-adaptive:** Automatically adjusts CTA positioning, scale, interaction mode for device/browser
- **EmotionMap integration:** CTA colors, animation intensity, messaging adapted to emotion state (trust, urgency, excitement)
- **Microinteraction logic:** Haptic feedback, sound, glow, ripple, animation, spatial audio, visual cues

4Ô∏è‚É£ Conversion, Analytics, and Testing
- **Full analytics tracking:** 3D/AR/VR CTA views, hovers, interactions, click-through, time-on-CTA, conversion events, retarget engagement
- **A/B/N & multivariate testing:** Run different CTA styles/placements, log performance, auto-optimize
- **Heatmap overlays:** Visualize user focus, interaction hotspots, engagement path inside the 3D/AR/VR environment

5Ô∏è‚É£ Integration & Extensibility
- **Plugin-ready:** Other empire modules/neuron can register new CTA templates, triggers, and reward/offer types
- **Federation API:** /api/cta3d/register, /api/cta3d/trigger, /api/cta3d/analytics
- **Can pull live offers, personalized content, product details from central config/semantic graph
- **Supports embedding video, 3D product demos, lead forms, and quizzes inside CTAs**

6Ô∏è‚É£ Security & Compliance
- **JWT/RBAC on all API calls and triggers**
- **Consent-aware:** Any AR/VR tracking is opt-in, with clear privacy controls for users

7Ô∏è‚É£ README & Docs
- **README.md must cover:**
  - Supported 3D/AR/VR stacks and how to switch between them
  - How to define/import CTAs, configure triggers, adapt to emotion/context
  - Analytics/event tracking and A/B test setup
  - API usage for other modules
  - Example configs (web AR, mobile VR, product demo, interactive quiz CTA)
  - Guidelines for ROI testing (run only in niches where immersive CTA outperforms standard UI)

8Ô∏è‚É£ Final Rules
- **DO NOT build demo-only code. Every CTA, trigger, and analytic must be real, working, and modular.**
- **No duplication‚Äîupgrade/merge with existing CTA logic if present.**
- **If stack/3D/AR/VR library is already in use, extend, don‚Äôt rebuild.**
- **Log all changes, outputs, and coverage in README.**
- **If no AR/VR device, simulate/test using browser/WebXR devtools.**

---
Make all database schemas, tables, and logic fully self-healing, migration-immune, and bootstrappable.
If DB is missing, empty, or new: auto-create schema, indexes, constraints, default config.
Pull all credentials (Supabase, etc.) only from .env ‚Äî no hardcode ever.
No direct SQL in UI ‚Äî all logic flows through hardened service/API layer.
Add init checks: validate schema health, retry on fail, show admin alerts if broken.
Ensure this module includes a fully provisioned, elite-grade, resilient database schema.
All tables, indexes, constraints, relationships, and API endpoints must be:
Migration-proof (works seamlessly across Replit accounts or environments)
Supabase-compatible (or any Postgres DB)
Auto-restoring (self-healing on project reboots or migrations)
Exportable & Documented (with schema diagrams + queries)


System must behave as if nothing broke ‚Äî even if DB was replaced 1 minute ago.
Resilience must match billion-dollar SaaS. No placeholders. No assumptions.

**DO THIS NOW. Output all backend, front-end, config, sample CTA templates, analytics, and docs.**  
If anything is already Empire Grade, harden/extend. If missing, build from scratch. Must be plug-and-play for ALL verticals and ready for the future of user interaction.
