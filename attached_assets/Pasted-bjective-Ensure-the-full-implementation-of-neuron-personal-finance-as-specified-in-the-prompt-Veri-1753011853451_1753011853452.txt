bjective: Ensure the full implementation of neuron-personal-finance as specified in the prompt. Verify if all the requirements and features from the original base prompt have been completed.

Tasks:

Federation OS:

Have you implemented the POST /api/neuron/register with the correct metadata (name, slug, URL, features, API token)?

Are the heartbeat and status POST requests being sent every 60 seconds with the required data?

Have you implemented the config pull from /api/neuron/update-config and analytics reporting?

UI/UX:

Is the UI modular and responsive, covering the main zones (Homepage, Blog, Quizzes, Tools, Offers, etc.)?

Are the emotional designs and color mappings (calm, urgency, optimism, etc.) applied to the UI components?

Have you added microinteractions and A/B testing elements?

Content Stack:

Have you crawled 100+ authoritative financial sources and ingested top-performing funnel patterns, content, and CTAs?

Are the required articles (100+), calculators (Budget Planner, Compound Interest, etc.), and quizzes (e.g., "What's Your Money Persona?") implemented?

Are dynamic offers (credit cards, robo-advisors, etc.) configured for auto-rotation and tracking?

AI/Personalization:

Is the personalization pipeline in place to detect user archetypes (e.g., “Student on a Budget”, “Growth Investor”) based on quiz or session behavior?

Are AI-driven experiments and content updates working correctly with Empire Core integration?

Have you integrated the LLM-powered Financial Advisor chatbot and all its logic?

Gamification:

Are streak-based challenges like "Money Quest" and the "Level Up Your Wallet" funnel implemented?

Are there user progress badges and leaderboards functioning correctly?

Analytics, Security & Compliance:

Are all user actions tracked (scrolls, clicks, quiz answers, CTA clicks, etc.) and synced with Empire Core?

Have you implemented GDPR/CCPA compliance with cookie banners, privacy policies, and "erase-me" endpoints?

Are affiliate compliance (proper disclosures, cloaked redirects) and error handling features in place?

Self-Evolving Intelligence:

Are AI-driven tasks (auto-scraping, content audits, AI-generated blog posts) working as expected?

Is the cron job functionality for flagging low CTR content and pushing new experiments running smoothly?

Documentation & Federation Integration:

Have you updated README.md and replit.md with the correct configuration for cloning and scaling the neuron?

Is the documentation clear on Federation API connections and how to specialize this neuron for new niches?

Cloning, Expansion & Futureproofing:

Have you ensured the neuron is scalable into future niches like neuron-credit-cards, neuron-investing-for-women with all content and logic modular?
