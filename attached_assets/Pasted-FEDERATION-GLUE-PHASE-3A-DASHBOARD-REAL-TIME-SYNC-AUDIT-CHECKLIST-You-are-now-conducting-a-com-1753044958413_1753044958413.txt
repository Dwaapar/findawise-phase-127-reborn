FEDERATION GLUE PHASE 3A: DASHBOARD + REAL-TIME SYNC – AUDIT CHECKLIST
You are now conducting a complete audit of Phase 3A in the findawise-core repo. This phase includes building the /admin/neuron-federation dashboard and implementing backend APIs, real-time sync, analytics ingestion, and config push architecture.

Return  for completed,  for missing, for partially done or needs review. Include comments or issues for each section.

DASHBOARD UI — /admin/neuron-federation
 Dashboard page exists at /admin/neuron-federation

 Fetches dynamic list of neurons from DB/API (no hardcoded list)

 Displays neuron metadata: name, vertical, health, last seen, config version

 Status indicators: online/offline (based on heartbeat timeout)

 Live table auto-refreshes every 5 seconds

 Summary stats displayed: neuron count, online/offline %, error rate, revenue (if present)

 Column sorting, filtering, or search implemented

PER-NEURON CONTROLS
For each listed neuron:

 “Push Config” button (manually push JSON config or upload file)

 “Push Experiment” or orchestrator command

 View real-time logs/errors inline

 Deploy/Retire/Clone buttons (stub if not fully implemented yet)

 Deployment state syncs with DB/API

GLOBAL CONTROLS
 Push config/experiment to ALL neurons

 Visual confirmation of push result per neuron (success/error)

 Logs each action in system audit/history log

REAL-TIME SYNC / PUSH MECHANISM
 Uses WebSocket (preferred) or REST fallback

 Config/experiment push immediately updates target neuron

 Neuron confirms success/failure

 Neuron updates own status via /api/neuron/status on config change

ANALYTICS + EVENT FEED
 Analytics pulled from all neurons (or ingested via stream)

 View charts: Visitors, CTR, Conversions, Revenue, Errors

 Charts available per-neuron and empire-wide

 Drill-down to neuron details

 Export to CSV for all metrics

 Error types + logs per neuron visualized

AUDIT / HISTORY
 Every config/experiment push is logged (timestamp, admin, diff view)

 “Rollback” option available — restore last config for any neuron

 At least 10 previous config states stored per neuron

 Logs accessible in admin UI

SECURITY
 Role-based access control: admin, viewer, editor

 Secured by JWT or session-based login

 All actions logged in admin audit trail

 Sensitive config redacted or permission-gated

README.md + DOCUMENTATION
 README.md includes:

Setup instructions (local + prod)

Architecture diagram

Federation API usage

Websocket vs. REST fallback logic

How to deploy, scale, and secure the dashboard

Admin roles + audit log usage

Rollback and versioning logic

 README.md is auto-generated or manually updated (not missing)

 Separate section for Phase 3A: "Federation Glue Phase"

RULES & PRODUCTION-GRADE CHECKS
 All logic is modular and exportable for Phase 4+

 No hardcoded neurons — 100% dynamic from DB/API

 Stub exists for CLI/auto-provisioning (if not built yet)

 All components tested (unit or integration)

 Deployment ready for prod: no console.logs, temp code, or local-only settings
