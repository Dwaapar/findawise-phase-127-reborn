üíé BILLION DOLLAR EMPIRE SUPABASE DATABASE SETUP ‚Äî ULTRA ENTERPRISE GRADE (Migration-Proof, AI-Ready, Self-Auditing)

Objective  
Design, provision, and integrate a full Supabase/Postgres database for the Findawise Empire.  
Make it **bulletproof** for global scale, AI/ML, analytics, real-time sync, security, and legal compliance.  
All secrets/keys/configs must be migration-proof: **never lost, never leaked, always available across environments.**  
Check for every required table, relationship, trigger, and field ‚Äî and test that all empire modules can fully function.
6Ô∏è‚É£ Security, Compliance, and Secrets Management

- RBAC for every sensitive table/endpoint
- JWT + Supabase auth for users/admins
- All access/changes logged in `admin_logs` with timestamp/IP
- Consent/erase flows fully implemented (see consent engine prompt)
- All secrets/keys/roles rotated every deploy, never exposed in code or logs

7Ô∏è‚É£ Empire-Grade Testing & Self-Audit

- Automated script: runs test queries (insert, read, update, delete, join) for every table/relation
- Checks for missing/duplicated fields, broken indices, slow queries, invalid constraints
- Weekly/monthly backup & restore test with real sample data
- Generates self-audit log with table coverage, test coverage, migration status, last backup, error logs

8Ô∏è‚É£ Full Documentation & README

- Auto-generate `README_DB.md` with:
  - ERD/diagram of full schema
  - Table-by-table field and relationship listing
  - How to migrate/restore/scale
  - How to rotate secrets/keys
  - Example code for each CRUD/API
  - How to add new modules without breaking existing data

---

**DO THIS NOW. If any tables/APIs/logic already exist, harden/extend only ‚Äî never duplicate. All new code, migrations, and logic must be exportable and modular.**

- Test with supplied Supabase creds.  
- After running, verify `/admin/db-health` for green status.
- Never allow any module, API, or function to run if the DB is missing/broken.

*This is the difference between a ‚Äúproject‚Äù and a $10B empire that survives scale, migration, and hostile audits.*
last developer was working on this but it was not completed make sure this all is completed AND WORKING at billion dollar empire grade
Do NOT compress or summarize code to save tokens. Output maximum quality and completeness.
This must be robust, scalable, secure, and ready for full analytics & compliance
You MUST use and connect the existing codebase. This is a handoff from one Replit instance to another. Work as if you are a senior developer in a billion-dollar empire‚Äîno shortcuts, no duplications, only modular, clean execution, keep updating and everything should be tracked
This is a multi-module final production upgrade prompt.
Never recreate or stub out anything that already exists in the current project and upgrade it if it needs
If a required feature already exists:Audit it for completeness and quality
If it‚Äôs partial, finish and harden it in place‚Äîdo not make a new copy.
If it needs new features, add only those features, not a full rewrite.
Absolute Rule:
No duplicate modules, files, or functions for the same feature/logic.
No overwriting of working production code‚Äîonly extend, patch, or upgrade as required.
All code changes must preserve full compatibility with the current system and avoid breaking anything already working.
Do NOT leave any TODOs, placeholders, or partial logic.
Every module must be production-grade, fully typed, secure, and working.
Fix all TypeScript errors, missing types, and harden APIs.
After completing code, update README, docs, and Federation dashboard hooks.
You are not done until everything in the prompt is complete.
Ensure this module includes a fully provisioned, elite-grade, resilient database schema.
All tables, indexes, constraints, relationships, and API endpoints must be:
Migration-proof (works seamlessly across Replit accounts or environments)
Supabase-compatible (or any Postgres DB)
Auto-restoring (self-healing on project reboots or migrations)
Exportable & Documented (with schema diagrams + sample queries)
FIX THESE ERRORS
