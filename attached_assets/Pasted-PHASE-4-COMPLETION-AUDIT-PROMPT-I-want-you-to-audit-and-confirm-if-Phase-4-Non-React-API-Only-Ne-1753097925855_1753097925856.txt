PHASE 4 COMPLETION AUDIT PROMPT

I want you to audit and confirm if Phase 4: Non-React/API-Only Neurons ‚Äî Empire Federation is fully and correctly implemented.

You MUST verify:

‚úÖ Federation Compliance
 Every API-only neuron POSTs to /api/neuron/register with all required fields: name, type, API endpoints, config, health, and API key/token.

 Neuron sends status/heartbeat every 60s to /api/neuron/status.

 Neuron can receive and apply config/experiment/command via /api/neuron/update-config (REST or gRPC).

 Neuron POSTs analytics/events to /api/analytics/report ‚Äî even if it has no UI.

‚úÖ Admin Dashboard Integration
 The /admin/neuron-federation dashboard lists API-only neurons with:

 Name, vertical/type

 Last heartbeat time

 Health + Error status

 Current config/version

 Exposed API endpoints

 Admin can:

 Push config/commands to API-only neurons

 Retire/reactivate API-only neurons

 View logs and errors

 See analytics summaries (calls, external API hits, error rates)

‚úÖ README + Onboarding Docs
 There is a README_API_NEURON_[NICHE].md for each backend neuron that includes:

 What the neuron does (scraper, data fetcher, ML model, etc.)

 How it federates (register, heartbeat, config, analytics)

 Sample code snippets (in Python, Go, Node, etc.)

 Security/auth setup (API key or JWT)

 Deployment + scaling instructions

 Logs/troubleshooting info

 The main README.md of the Empire repo has a new section:

üìò ‚ÄúAPI-Only / Headless Neuron Federation‚Äù

 Describes how API-only neurons work, how to onboard, monitor, and scale them

 Lists security rules, heartbeat rules, audit trail expectations

‚úÖ Production Readiness
 At least one working backend/API-only neuron is deployed (e.g., Python scraper, LLM assistant, or data microservice)

 Neuron is modular, monitored, and sends real events + logs

 System auto-retires the neuron on repeated failures or missing heartbeat

 All federation APIs are protected by secure auth (API key or JWT)

 Audit logs exist for all actions (config push, errors, commands, retries)

‚õî If ANY of these are missing:
Clearly list:
