Auto-register all created content/tools in sitemap, semantic intent graph, analytics, admin panel.

All outputs must include code, config, tests, admin UI, full README, and schema diagrams.

If any logic is missing or underdeveloped, upgrade it to match this prompt.

Everything must pass Lighthouse, Core Web Vitals, WAVE, and security compliance checks.

All logs, errors, exports, backups, and migrations must be tested and documented.
