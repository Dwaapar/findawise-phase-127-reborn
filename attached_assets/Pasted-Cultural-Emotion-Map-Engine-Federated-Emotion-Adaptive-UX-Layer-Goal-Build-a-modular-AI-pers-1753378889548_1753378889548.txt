Cultural Emotion Map Engine (Federated, Emotion-Adaptive UX Layer)
🎯 Goal:
Build a modular, AI-personalized Cultural Emotion Map Engine that dynamically adapts UX elements (colors, CTAs, offer stacks, urgency logic, tone, copy) based on cultural, regional, and persona-based emotion mappings — in real-time and across all empire modules.

🔩 Features Required:
Emotion Mapping Schema:

Define a master schema linking emotion → color → CTA tone → urgency level → language tone → funnel structure

Region-specific adaptations:

Example: Red = Luck (CN), Red = Danger (US)

Urgency = Excitement (US), Urgency = Stress (DE), Urgency = Fear (JP)

Auto-Detection Engine:

Detect cultural context via:

IP geolocation

Browser locale

User persona

Quiz/intent data

Neural profile memory

Adaptation Targets:

Pages (themes, color palettes)

CTAs (copy, placement, urgency tone)

Offer presentation (discount framing, social proof)

Copywriting and messaging tone

Emotional UX (timing, triggers, nudges)

🛠 Admin UI: /admin/culture-map
Cultural rule editor: create, edit, clone, import/export

Live simulation: preview UX for CN, US, JP, DE, IN, etc.

A/B/N cultural variant tester (CTR, conversion, trust impact)

Override logic: per campaign or persona

Feedback inbox from users or neurons

🔗 Federation & Orchestrator Integration:
All neurons/modules can:

Request emotion logic for their locale/persona

Push emotion feedback or overrides upstream

Emotion map versioning + propagation

Hooks for:

Page Generator

Offer Engine

Personalization Core

Orchestrator AI

📊 Analytics, Experiments & Feedback Loop:
Track:

Emotional adaptation success (CTR, CVR, trust metrics)

Emotional A/B variant performance

Segment-specific insights (e.g. “fear tone underperforms in DE”)

Self-learning emotion map (fed back into future mapping)

🔐 Security & Compliance:
Rule changes are RBAC-protected

Changes logged with who/when/what/why

GDPR/consent-aware cultural adaptation

📘 README (MANDATORY):
