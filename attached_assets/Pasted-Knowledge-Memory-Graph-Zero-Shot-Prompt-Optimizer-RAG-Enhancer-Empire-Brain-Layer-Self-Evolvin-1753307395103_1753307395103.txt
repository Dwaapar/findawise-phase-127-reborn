Knowledge Memory Graph + Zero-Shot Prompt Optimizer + RAG Enhancer
(Empire Brain Layer, Self-Evolving, AI-Ready, Federation-Synced)

🎯 Objective
Give the empire a living, ever-evolving memory system that stores, relates, and intelligently recalls every fact, article, insight, user journey, product, and experiment — and supercharges all AI responses via retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and prompt optimization.

🧬 1. Knowledge Memory Graph
Hybrid vector + relational knowledge base:

PostgreSQL + ChromaDB/Weaviate/FAISS + optional Neo4j

Auto-adds nodes for:

Blog posts, quizzes, products, offers, LLM summaries, feedback, reviews, test results, user journeys, SEO insights

Each node includes:

embedding, slug, type, metadata, timestamp, userArchetype, conversionData, linkedCTA

Auto-connects with labeled edges:

related_to, used_in, causes, contradicts, improves, leads_to, flagged_by, supersedes

Versioned and diff-tracked (rollbacks, approval queue)

✅ API:

/api/memory/search?q=...

/api/memory/add

/api/memory/related?slug=...

/api/memory/update

/api/memory/logs?nodeId=...

⚡ 2. Zero-Shot Prompt Optimizer + RAG Enhancer
Auto-fetches top-K memory nodes relevant to current task/user

Rewrites prompt with:

Contextual facts

Past decisions

User behavior (journey stage, interest graph)

Prompt injection logic:

Biases toward recent, high-conversion, verified nodes

Filters stale, low-impact, redundant nodes

✅ Supports multimodal memory:

Text, Markdown, tables, JSON, reviews, video/image descriptions, conversations

✅ Fallback logic:

If no matching node:
→ call explorer agent to fetch from external web OR
→ inject standard empire prompt template

🔁 3. Federation + Real-Time Sync
All neurons push/pull from the graph

Event-driven sync:

New offers, quizzes, blog edits, test results, user feedback

Federation APIs:

Register node type, event hook, permission scope

Admin UI:

Browse/edit/search graph

Approve/reject/merge suggestions

View what prompt fragments were injected where and why

🔐 4. Security, Logging, Governance
Each mutation logged with:

Auth token, user/session, source type, confidence score

Full versioning:

Diff UI, rollback, timestamp

RBAC:

Which neurons/agents can write/modify specific node types

📘 5. README (MANDATORY)
Diagrams:

Graph structure

Prompt rewrite flow

Injection points

Setup guide:

DB setup, vector index sync, federation API usage

Sample:

From new offer → user quiz → summary node → LLM prompt → page output

🔥 Final Enhancements (Recommended for Trillion-Scale AI)
🔥 5A. Prompt Graph Memory Compiler
Build a graph of injected prompt fragments across sessions

Trace impact of memory over time

Replay chains to understand success/failure

🔥 5B. Auto-Ranking & Aging of Memory
Auto-score nodes based on:

Usage, click-throughs, conversion, bounce, freshness

Down-rank noisy, outdated, or low-impact facts

🔥 5C. Memory-Marketplace Protocol
Other empires (or your own neurons) can request memory nodes via marketplace API

Includes opt-in public memory layers (for sharing knowledge across instances)

🔥 5D. Agent Memory Feedback Loop
LLM/agent sends back result of prompt → user behavior → updates graph confidence scores

Builds a true feedback loop: "learning from reality"

🔥 5E. Compression & Pruning Engine
Periodically condense similar nodes

Archive stale ones

Merge redundant summaries automatically
