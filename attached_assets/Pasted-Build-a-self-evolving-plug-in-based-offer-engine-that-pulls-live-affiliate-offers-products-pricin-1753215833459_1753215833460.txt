Build a self-evolving, plug-in based offer engine that pulls live affiliate offers, products, pricing, coupons, and API data from all major networks, and updates pages, neurons, quizzes, recommendations, CTAs, and dashboards in real time — across all regions, verticals, and emotions.

🔩 1. Multi-Source Integration Layer (Zero Lock-In)
✅ Support at least 3 ingestion modes:

REST/GraphQL APIs: Amazon, CJ, Impact, ShareASale, SaaS APIs (plugin format)

Web-scraping (fallback for non-API sites) via Playwright/Cheerio

Manual uploads: CSV/JSON uploader for niche networks or private deals

🔌 Plugin Architecture:

Every affiliate integration = its own modular adapter

Config/credentials stored securely (JWT-encrypted + federated token-based access)

📦 2. Smart Offer Feed Engine (Modular, Clean, Upgradable)
Schema per offer:

id, title, slug, merchant, price, old_price, currency, coupon_code, discount_type, valid_till, region, emotion, category, tags, source_type, is_expired, click_tracking_url, api_source, commission_estimate, meta, LLM_summary, intent_embedding

🔁 Auto-updates:

Cron/worker runs hourly or event-triggered

Remove stale/dead offers

Cache recent changes (incremental sync)

⚡️ 3. Real-Time Update Pipeline (Global Broadcast)
Trigger system:

New/updated offers trigger re-render of:

Product carousels

Smart CTAs

Quiz outcomes

Top-deals sidebar

Offer comparison tables

Price trackers, affiliate widgets

/go/[slug] tracker

Federation Events:

Notify all neurons via /api/offer-feed/broadcast

Auto-push to federated verticals by niche, emotion, and region

🔍 4. AI-Powered Filtering & Personalization
/api/offers/search endpoint:

Filters by merchant, geo, device, intent, price band, LTV, historical CTR

✅ Integrate with:

Semantic Graph: fetch intent-matched deals per page/session

Personalization Engine: match user profile vector → top deals

Emotion Map: CTA visuals, discounts styled to user’s emotion state

🧠 5. Analytics, Compliance & Intelligence Loop
Track everything:

Clicks, conversions, revenue per slug/merchant

Geo/device/session context → pushed to analytics layer

Compliance Logic:

Auto-hide banned/expired/deceptive offers (Amazon, Google TOS-safe)

“Disclosures” module for legal banner injection

AI Optimization:

Detect stale offers (low CTR, no click in 7 days)

Feed to Codex or AI auditor for rewriting, reorder, or replacement

🖥 6. Admin Panel — /admin/offer-feed
Live feed view

Search/edit/add/flag/retry/offline offers

Performance leaderboard

Deal expiration alerts

Auto-suggested new offers from LLMs

API import wizard (add new source in 3 steps)

🤖 7. Automation + AI Layer (Self-Improving)
Codex Integration:

Auto-pause underperforming offers

Auto-create new “combo offers” or price-match banners

Run experiments (A/B test price, title, image, CTA phrasing)

Future Add-ons:

RL algorithm to reorder top offers dynamically

Affiliate arbitrage optimizer (maximize payout via multiple links)

🔐 8. Federation + API Layer (Empire-Wide Access)
Expose secure routes:

GET /api/offer-feed/search

POST /api/offer-feed/sync

GET /api/offer-feed/by-niche/:niche

POST /api/offer-feed/trigger

Federation Token System:

Every neuron/module can register to receive:

Live deal updates

Pushed segment-specific feeds

AI-prioritized best offers

📘 9. README & Docs
Must auto-generate:

README_offer_feed.md

Plugin format: how to add new affiliate API

Offer structure, click tracking, config, backup/export, troubleshooting

Real example payloads + cURL testing commands

💥 Output Requirements
Requirement	Status
✅ No demo/stub logic	Must be real sync, real feed
✅ Modular codebase	Plugins per API source, adapters per neuron
✅ Federation-ready	Neurons can receive + inject offers dynamically
✅ Admin dashboard	Required. Must be live-updating, flagging, searchable
✅ Analytics loop	Clicks/conversions/stats stored + fed to Codex
✅ Emotion-aware offer logic	Offers styled/adapted based on user emotion
✅ AI Slot-Ready	Can be controlled/orchestrated via LLM prompt chaining

🧬 Empire Law:
Every new neuron, quiz, or page must get intent-mapped, emotion-matched, live feed-ready offers auto-assigned — no manual duplication or static offers allowed.

🚀 Prompt Summary:
This engine is the beating heart of empire monetization. No dead offers. No lag. No manual config.
Every offer = dynamic, AI-curated, real-time personalized, and globally federated.
