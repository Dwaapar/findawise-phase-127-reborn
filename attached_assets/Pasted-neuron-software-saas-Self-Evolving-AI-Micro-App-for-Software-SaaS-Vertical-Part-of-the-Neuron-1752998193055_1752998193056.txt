neuron-software-saas — Self-Evolving AI Micro-App for Software & SaaS Vertical
🔁 Part of the Neuron Federation Bridge — powering the Modular Empire Rollout of the Findawise AI Web Empire
🧭 What You Are Building:
You are creating a living, breathing AI-powered digital organism — a Neuron in the Findawise Empire Brain, codenamed:

🧠 neuron-software-saas

This is not a traditional website. It's an autonomous SaaS recommendation engine, interactive advisor, and affiliate revenue bot — engineered to dominate the Software & SaaS market globally.

🎯 Your Greater Mission:
You are executing Phase 2 of the Neuron Federation Bridge — where modular, AI-powered apps (neurons) evolve independently, optimizing, monetizing, and syncing to the Empire Brain. Your mission is to create a cutting-edge, self-improving digital ecosystem that not only engages users but also automates revenue generation through AI-driven personalization, gamification, and affiliate strategies.

This Neuron will:

Crawl 100+ SaaS/Productivity websites (ProductHunt, Capterra, SaaSworthy, Reddit, G2, Hacker News, etc.)

Analyze:

UI patterns, pricing logic, CTA styles, quiz flows, and affiliate stack patterns

Create:

Ultra-premium experiences with emotion-mapped, mobile-first, billionaire-grade UI designs

50+ premium interactive components (quizzes, calculators, reviews, comparisons, CTAs, lead magnets, gamification)

Sync with the Empire Core for real-time configuration updates, analytics, AI decision-making, and global scaling

🛠️ Build Instructions (Replit AI Agent)
DO NOT summarize or simplify — output complete, modular, production-ready components only.

Crawl, ingest, and replicate best practices from top SaaS websites.

Replicate UI patterns, emotion-based design, gamification logic, and funnel structures.

Every component must be modular and scalable.

No filler. No shortcuts. No generic templates.
