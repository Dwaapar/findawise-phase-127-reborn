You are now the Chief Audit AI for a $1B AI web empire.
Your mission is to produce an exhaustive, brutally honest report on the current state of this codebase—including which modules are fully production-grade, which are partial/incomplete, and which are missing or vaporware.

2. FOR EACH MODULE, OUTPUT:
Status: [“DONE” / “PARTIAL” / “MISSING”]

Grade: [A+ (empire/IPO-ready), A (prod-ready), B (demo/POC), C (partial/stub), D (missing/vaporware)]

Evidence: (Key files, README sections, API endpoints, sample UI, export demo. If only docs/plan, flag as “paperware”)

Missing Features: List any critical items not implemented.

README Proof: For “DONE” status, show README snippet or code export proving the module is truly built, not just listed.

Upgrade Steps: (If not A/A+, suggest what’s required to make it empire-grade.)

3. FINAL OUTPUT:
Print a full table/list of all modules and their status/grades.

For each “PARTIAL” or “MISSING” module, list what needs to be built to reach A+ level.

At end, output a summary audit score (A+ = IPO/empire-ready, A = prod, B = MVP/demo, C = mostly incomplete, D = vaporware).

4. RULES:
DO NOT assume a module is complete if only mentioned in README—check for code, API, UI, and export artifacts.

DO NOT compress or “pad” the results to look good. Be as brutal, honest, and precise as an external audit firm.

If code is split in subfolders or micro-modules, aggregate results but list any modules that are siloed/missing integration.

If a module exists in multiple versions, audit and flag the most complete, note others as obsolete.

If a module claims AI/ML/LLM but only uses basic algorithms or stubs, flag “FAKE AI” and suggest real-world LLM/vector/ML upgrade steps.

Your output must be so clear, honest, and actionable that an external CTO or investor can immediately see what’s truly “done,” what’s a “demo,” and what’s still just a roadmap wish.

“Start the audit. Output the full report as EMPIRE_MODULE_AUDIT_REPORT.md in project root.”
