Build a modular, real-time funnel engine that intelligently guides users across a sequence of quizzes, calculators, content unlocks, games, lead forms, offers, and CTAs — adapting dynamically based on behavior, intent, emotion, and AI signals. The system must be fully admin-controllable, AI-personalizable, analytics-looped, and federation-compatible.

🧩 1. Funnel Builder & Activity Block System
/admin/funnel-dashboard:

Visual drag-and-drop interface

Blocks: Quiz, Calculator, Mini-Game, Poll, Survey, Content Unlock, Video Watch, Social Share, Feedback, Milestone, Offer Stack, Email, Push, Upsell, CTA, Reward Drop

Blocks are:

Reusable

Configurable (rules, entry logic, personalization, rewards, AI hooks)

Exportable/importable as JSON

Funnel states save per-user with reentry/resume logic

⚙️ 2. Event-Driven, Adaptive Funnel Flows
Trigger logic supports:

Scroll %, time on block, quiz result, inactivity, referral, milestone, session vector, persona match

Smart branching per event or LLM suggestion

Path mutation in real-time as user interacts

Sessions store engagement, context, segment, emotion vector, device, geo

🧠 3. Advanced Personalization & AI/ML Engine
Live personalization of blocks and paths using:

User intent vector + persona + emotion + prior funnels

AI “next best action” engine:

Suggest next funnel step or skip

Modify copy, block type, CTA based on engagement

LLM-based suggestion engine:

Recommend better copy/questions/steps

Auto-flag low performers

Enable A/B/N and multi-arm bandit testing via ML

🔢 4. Analytics, Split Testing, and Export
Track per-step:

Views, CTR, bounce/drop, dwell time, completions, conversion, ROI

Export:

Full funnel schema

Event logs + anonymized user journeys

AI training datasets

Funnel-level dashboard:

Heatmaps, Sankey, conversion tree, cohort analytics, split test manager

🔁 5. Funnel-to-Everywhere Integration Engine
On complete or partial journey:

Auto-enroll in: push/email/SMS/WhatsApp

Trigger retargeting pixels/campaigns

Pass user vector to Federation Core

Webhooks to other modules: /api/funnel/complete, /api/segment/update

🛡️ 6. Security, Compliance & Governance
GDPR/CCPA/Opt-In/EraseMe ready

Consent banners, geo-awareness (EU, US, India)

All admin and API routes:

JWT + RBAC protected

Audit logs:

Funnel edits, exports, data views

🖥️ 7. Admin UX + AI Assistant Panel
/admin/funnel-dashboard includes:

Block builder + config

Journey visualizer

Analytics panel

Split test manager

AI optimization panel (suggestions from LLM or ML logs)

Import/export manager (backup, clone, cross-neuron)

📘 8. README & Documentation (MANDATORY)
README_funnel.md must include:

How to build and publish funnels

API docs (create, edit, trigger, fetch)

How to integrate notification, offer modules

Funnel analytics structure

Scaling and federation guide

Sample payloads for automation agents

💥 Output Requirements
✅ All blocks fully implemented, no demo-only or placeholder

✅ Funnels must be live-testable, exportable, and resumable

✅ AI slots ready for both real-time and offline learning

✅ Full support for Web/PWA/native wrapper

✅ Deliver: backend API, admin UI, frontend funnel engine, sample blocks, analytics, docs

🧠 Empire-Level Bonuses (If Needed)
Gamified Funnel Paths:

XP, Badges, Milestones, Unlocks

RAG-Ready Content Unlocking

Emotion-Driven CTA Insertions

Resume-on-other-device funnel state

LLM/agent-based funnel generators

✨ Final Instruction:
DO THIS NOW.
Don’t compress logic. Don’t stub steps.
This will become the “money brain” of your empire.
Once built, it will self-evolve, continuously improving conversions, retention, and revenue.
