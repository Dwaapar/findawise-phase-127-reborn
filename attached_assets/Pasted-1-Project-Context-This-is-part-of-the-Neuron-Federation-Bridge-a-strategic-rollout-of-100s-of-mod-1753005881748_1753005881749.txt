1. Project Context:
This is part of the Neuron Federation Bridge, a strategic rollout of 100s of modular, living digital micro-apps across niches.

You’re building:
neuron-health-and-wellness
A self-evolving, emotion-mapped, ultra-modern micro-application designed to dominate the global health & wellness niche.

This neuron will:

Auto-scale across content verticals (diet, sleep, mental health, fitness, etc.)

Update in real-time based on AI-powered insights

Sync with the Findawise Empire Brain for personalization, experimentation, and revenue optimization.

🔁 2. Federation OS (Empire Core Sync)
Boot Phase:

POST /api/neuron/register with:

name, slug, type, url, supported_features, token (from .env)

Schedule POST /api/neuron/status every 60s with:

heartbeat, uptime, CPU/mem usage, user sessions, error logs

Live Config Sync:

GET /api/neuron/update-config pulls:

Orchestration commands

Feature toggles

Experiment definitions

LLM prompt injection rules

Analytics:

POST /api/analytics/report on:

Page load, scroll depth, tool usage, quiz input/output

CTA clicks, form submits, affiliate conversions

Session archetype detection + confidence score

Security:

All routes protected by API token + rate limit rules

🎨 3. Mastercrafted UI/UX
Built as Webpack Module Federation remote or REST/gRPC (non-React)

Design logic:

Emotion → Theme

Calm → Sleep/Meditation

Energetic → Fitness

Trustworthy → Mental Health

Playful → Quizzes, gamified tools

Microinteractions:

Scroll parallax, animated metrics, “urgency banners,” fluid transitions

Color modes + archetype overlays (dark/light/calm/safety)

📚 4. Content & Offer Engine
Crawl + ingest 100+ sources:

Primary: Healthline, WebMD, Mayo Clinic, MyFitnessPal, PubMed

Secondary: YouTube influencers (e.g., Dr. Berg, Huberman), Reddit, WHO

Curate: Do not copy. Use as reference for:

CTA patterns, tool ideas, affiliate funnels

Include:

100+ articles (LLM generated or edited, not scraped)

20+ lead magnets: trackers, ebooks, diet plans, wellness checklists

Dynamic offer stack: supplements, wearables, apps

Auto-rotate via config

Geo/intent-based routing

Cloaked tracking URLs

🧠 5. Personalization & AI Logic
User Archetypes:

“The Sleepless Pro”

“The Diet Starter”

“The Overwhelmed Parent”

“The Biohacker”

Personalization Pipeline:

Archetype detected from quiz OR session behavior

All CTAs, colors, tools, offers, language adapt instantly

Content block selection = based on past behavior + segment + AI Orchestrator input

LLM Functions:

Generate articles (triggered weekly if content count < config threshold)

Suggest new quizzes, re-order funnel if conversion score < threshold

Validate quiz complexity based on user exit rate

Auto-scraper tasks (cron):

Weekly ingestion of:

Top 20 trending health search terms (via Google Trends/YT/Reddit)

New affiliate offers

Tool feature requests from Reddit threads

Self-healing:

Content with bounce rate > X triggers:

Alert + AI-enhanced rewrite (auto-pull in references)

🛠️ 6. Tools, Quizzes, & Gamification
Quizzes:

“Which Wellness Persona Are You?”

“Best Diet for You”

“Your Personalized Sleep Plan”

Results = Archetype + Score + Offers + Suggested Trackers

Calculators/Tools:

BMI, BMR, Sleep Debt, Daily Calorie Target, Water Intake, Supplement Stack Recommender

Each stores session + emits analytics

Tools are emotion-mapped:

BMI = trust

Sleep = calm

Fitness = action

Gamification:

Daily quest cards (hydration, journaling, sleep goal)

XP + streaks + virtual wellness points

Optional: share streak to get bonus ebook/discount

Leaderboard (opt-in)

📊 7. Analytics, Experiments, A/B
POST /api/analytics/report:

Tool opened → Output generated → CTA clicked

Quiz started → Answer path → Funnel exit point

Scroll depth on blog → Exit intent detection

Empire Core runs:

A/B/N:

Hero CTA text

Quiz start phrasing

Offer stacks

Form layouts

Tracks:

Conversion per archetype

Abandoned quiz rate

Time-on-tool vs engagement

🛡️ 8. Security, Compliance, Logs
Consent banner (multi-language)

Cookie + affiliate disclaimers

API tokens = dynamic via .env

GDPR opt-out (“Erase Me” support)

All errors logged to /logs + exported to Core

Uptime monitor with automatic fallback config

📦 9. README.md & replit.md (Documentation Sync)
Must update, not overwrite or create new files

Add:

Project name, slug, type

Federation endpoints status

Analytics tracking map

Tool behavior and inputs/outputs

Customization instructions (colors, tools, offers)

What’s done ✅, what’s pending 🛠️

🧠 10. Scaling Strategy
Use archetypes to create 50–200 emotion-adaptive pages:

Pages auto-generated per persona (calm, energetic, sleep-focused, etc.)

Each quiz output → new page (funnel pages)

Cloning logic:

This base neuron → neuron-diet-plans, neuron-fitness-beginners, neuron-sleep-optimizer

All sub-pages use central federation sync

Every tool, blog, quiz = its own versioned module
