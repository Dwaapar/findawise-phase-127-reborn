Multi-Region Load Orchestrator (Edge-Aware, Empire-Scale Routing Core)
üéØ Goal:
Build a modular, auto-scaling Multi-Region Load Orchestrator that intelligently routes traffic, AI tasks, content, and analytics across edge nodes and regions (e.g., Vercel Edge, Cloudflare Workers, AWS/GCP/Azure, or local infrastructure) ‚Äî optimizing for latency, cost, resilience, and global personalization.

üî© Features Required:
üì° Region Detection Engine
Detect user region via:

IP + GeoIP database

Browser language + timezone

User's previous session or neural profile

Classify into:

Closest latency node

Federated zone (India, EU, US, etc.)

User‚Äôs preferred region (for sticky sessions)

üß† AI-Aware Load Distribution
Route:

API calls

Static + dynamic content

AI model requests

Personalization/state data

Load balancing algorithms:

Round robin (default)

AI-prioritized (cost/latency aware)

Neural weight (send to best-trained model or content for region)

üõ† Admin UI: /admin/load-orchestrator
Region overview dashboard (map + metrics)

Load per region, latency, request volume

Manual override: force-route a zone

Add/remove/update region nodes

Failover preview & simulation mode

üîå Federation & Orchestrator Sync
Each neuron auto-registers preferred zones

Federation Core can push:

Live routing rules

Failover commands

Custom prioritization (e.g. route all JP traffic to Tokyo edge)

Syncs with:

Personalization Engine

Offer Engine

CDN Cache Manager

Disaster Recovery Controller

üí• Edge Node Logic & Cache Sync
Cache & data replication engine:

Syncs config, offers, personalization data

Region-aware invalidation (by user cohort or funnel)

Real-time purge system (per asset or full wipe)

Supported edge layers:

Vercel Edge Functions

Cloudflare Workers

AWS Lambda@Edge / API Gateway

Custom Kubernetes/GCP/Azure fallback

üß™ Health Monitoring & Failover System
Heartbeat check for every node (latency, error rate, memory usage)

Auto-failover triggers if:

Latency > threshold

Node unavailable for > X seconds

Cost/performance triggers

Alert system: Slack/email/API trigger

üîê Security & Permissions
Region-level RBAC (e.g. India node can‚Äôt access US logs)

Logs of all routing/failover decisions

JWT signing per node for secure federation and failover

üìò README (MANDATORY)
Region setup guide (how to deploy & register new region)

Fallback & routing logic explanation

Admin panel guide

Scaling playbook (manual + automated scaling)

Integration points:

CDN

Personalization

Orchestrator

Federation protocol

‚úÖ Deliverables
Modular, federated region router

Admin UI /admin/load-orchestrator (map, status, override, history)

Federated failover + cache sync logic

Full heartbeat & routing log system

Region scaling docs, fallback checklist, recovery playbook

Support for real-time load testing + simulated outage

CLI/API for adding/removing nodes on the fly
