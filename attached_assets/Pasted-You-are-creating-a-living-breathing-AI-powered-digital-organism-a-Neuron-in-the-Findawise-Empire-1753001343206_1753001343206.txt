You are creating a living, breathing, AI-powered digital organism — a Neuron in the Findawise Empire Brain — codenamed:

🧠 neuron-software-saas

This is not a basic website. It is an autonomous SaaS recommendation engine, interactive advisor, and affiliate revenue bot — engineered to dominate the Software & SaaS market globally.

🎯 Your Greater Mission:
You are executing Phase 2 of the Neuron Federation Bridge — where modular AI-powered apps (neurons) independently evolve, optimize, monetize, and sync to the Empire Brain.

This Neuron will:

Crawl 100+ SaaS/productivity websites (ProductHunt, Capterra, SaaSworthy, Reddit, G2, Hacker News)

Analyze UI, pricing logic, CTA styles, quiz flows, and affiliate stack patterns

Create ultra-premium, emotion-mapped, mobile-first, billionaire-grade experiences

Integrate 50+ components: quizzes, calculators, reviews, comparisons, CTAs, lead magnets, gamification, dynamic offer carousels

Sync with the Empire Core for config, analytics, AI decisions, and global scaling

🛠️ Build Instructions (Replit AI Agent)
DO NOT summarize or simplify — output complete modules

As you work, log tasks in README.md and replit.md

Crawl, ingest, and replicate best practices from top SaaS sites

Pull UI patterns, emotion mapping, gamification logic, and funnel structures

Output only modular, production-ready components

🔗 MANDATORY Federation OS Features:
POST /api/neuron/register on boot: includes name, url, type, features, slug, .env token

POST /api/neuron/status every 60s: uptime, health, analytics heartbeat

GET /api/neuron/update-config: experiment updates, AI config, orchestrator commands

POST /api/analytics/report: all events (pageviews, clicks, quizzes, offers, session meta)

Secure ALL endpoints using .env API key/token

Logs & errors sent to /logs, with retry/fallback logic

🔮 Emotion-Based UI/UX Engine
Webpack Module Federation (React) or REST/gRPC endpoints

Fully modular, mobile-first, and responsive layout

Themes based on emotion/intent:

“Urgent Buyer” → FOMO timers, sharp CTAs

“Freelancer” → calm, customizable tool bundles

“Startup CTO” → comparison tables, enterprise features

Pixel-perfect UI: Home, Blog, Offers, Tool Pages, Comparison, Quizzes, Pricing, Landing, Thank You, 404

Dynamically change:

AI-driven experiments:

Reorder tools by conversion

Auto-generate new articles

Flag outdated blogs, dead offers

Self-healing logic if config/API fails

📊 Analytics, Export, & Compliance
Track all events → /api/analytics/report

Backup/export: analytics, content, logs, offer config

GDPR/CCPA banners, privacy policy, consent buttons

Cookie handling, affiliate disclaimers

“Erase Me” API

📚 README + Replit Logs
Auto-generate README.md with:

Overview, Setup, Federation, Features, Analytics, Experiments, Scaling

How to replicate for other SaaS categories (e.g., neuron-crm, neuron-ai-tools)

replit.md must track all major changes, missing modules, TODOs, errors

🧬 Self-Evolution Logic (Empire-Synced)
Auto-scraper for SaaS launches (e.g., ProductHunt API)

LLM content generator:

New blog posts

Updated quiz logic

Variant CTA copy

Self-audit cron:

Remove tools with low conversion

Flag old blogs without updates

Orchestrator pulls: A/B tests, new config, copy suggestions

🧠 FINAL DIRECTIVE
Treat this as a modular revenue-producing startup in a box — not just a frontend page.
This Neuron must self-improve, self-analyze, and self-optimize — every user, every session, every click.

No filler.
No shortcuts.
No generic templates.

You are building a Billion-Dollar-Grade AI SaaS Advisor Engine — a flagship Neuron in the Findawise Empire Federation.
