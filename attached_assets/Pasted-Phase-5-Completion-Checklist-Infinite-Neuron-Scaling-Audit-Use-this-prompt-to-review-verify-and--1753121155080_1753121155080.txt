Phase 5 Completion Checklist — Infinite Neuron Scaling Audit
Use this prompt to review, verify, and finalize the Scaling & Automation phase for your Neuron Federation Empire. The checklist will confirm that CLI tools, automation workflows, dashboard controls, and deployment systems are fully operational, secure, and compliant with the Phase 5 specs.

🔍 Core CLI Tool Audit — findawise-cli
✅ neuron create --niche=[vertical]

 Spins up neuron from a template/config

 Auto-registers neuron via /api/neuron/register

 Sets up default content, offers, layout, and env config

 Logs the action with timestamp and user ID

✅ neuron clone --source=[existing] --niche=[new]

 Duplicates content, tools, layout

 Renames and re-registers new instance

 Updates Federation dashboard with new ID/status

✅ neuron onboard --file=neurons.csv

 Onboards 10–100 neurons from config/CSV

 Each is registered, booted, configured, and listed live

 Supports CLI log/summary report

✅ neuron retire --id=[neuronID]

 Updates neuron status in core DB/API

 Triggers shutdown/cleanup (config & analytics)

 Logs the action with rollback timestamp

✅ neuron status

 Returns list of all registered neurons

 Displays health, uptime, heartbeat, analytics summary

 Refreshable or streamable (websocket or polling)

✅ CLI must:

 Be installable on Mac, Linux, Windows

 Use secure API token from .env

 Log all actions with RBAC/auth metadata

 Provide --help or neuron --help documentation

 Fail gracefully with error logs

🧭 Dashboard UI — /admin/empire-launchpad
✅ Displays:

 List of all active/retired neurons

 Real-time status (green = healthy, red = offline, yellow = syncing)

 Federation info: last config sync, heartbeat time, traffic metrics

✅ Controls:

 Deploy new neuron via GUI (same as CLI)

 Clone neuron visually

 Push config or experiment to one or all neurons

 Retire neuron from UI

✅ Extras:

 Neuron visual map (by niche/category)

 Log viewer or export (JSON/CSV)

 Live console or status updates every 5–10s

📊 Monitoring & Analytics
✅ Real-time metrics for:

 Visitors per neuron

 CTR/conversions per tool/offer

 Error rates, uptime, config version

 Config change history

✅ Alert logic:

 Failed config push → alert via UI/log

 Neuron offline > 3 min → status change + alert

 Sync/version mismatch → flagged visually

✅ Export/Download:

 CSV or JSON export of analytics and logs

 API endpoint to fetch analytics per neuron

🔐 Security, Logs, and Auditing
✅ CLI and dashboard both:

 Require secure token or JWT-based login

 Log all actions to /logs/cli.log or DB

 Support RBAC (admin, ops, viewer roles)

 Can export logs for audit or compliance

✅ Rollback:

 Each neuron’s last 10 config states saved

 Can roll back to previous config via CLI or dashboard

📁 Documentation (MANDATORY)
✅ README.md (Phase 5 — Empire Launchpad)

 Overview of CLI and dashboard usage

 Installation/setup for findawise-cli

 Scaling logic (how to reach 100–1000 neurons)

 Troubleshooting tips

 CLI command reference + examples

✅ CLI Help System

 neuron --help or neuron [cmd] --help provides detailed usage

 Inline descriptions for all flags/options

 Failure examples and exit codes

🧪 Deliverable Audit (Final Outputs)
✅ Do you have:

 Working CLI with tested create, clone, retire, status, onboard commands

 Scalable /admin/empire-launchpad dashboard with full controls

 Real-time monitoring and push sync to all neurons

 Logs and error tracking + rollback

 README and CLI docs

 Deployment proof (test run with 10+ neurons in logs/screenshots)

⚠️ Run This Final Check Prompt:
diff
Copy
Edit
Run Phase 5 completion audit:
- Simulate a bulk deployment of 10+ neurons via CLI
- Retire 2 neurons and observe status changes in dashboard
- Push an orchestrator update to all neurons
- Trigger a rollback for one config
- Export logs and download analytics for 1 neuron
- Confirm CLI logs all actions + dashboard reflects changes in <10s
