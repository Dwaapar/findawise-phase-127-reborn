AUDIT PROMPT: Federation Compliance & Feature Completion for neuron-ai-tools
You are now reviewing the neuron-ai-tools micro-app for full compliance with the Findawise Federation Architecture and feature requirements. Verify the following checkboxes are fully implemented, secure, and operational. For each item, return ✅ if complete, ❌ if missing, and 🟡 if partial or needs review.

⚙️ Federation Core Protocols
✅ POST /api/neuron/register fires on boot with correct metadata and token

✅ POST /api/neuron/status fires every 60s with health, uptime, analytics snapshot

✅ GET /api/neuron/update-config correctly pulls orchestrator config and applies updates

✅ POST /api/analytics/report logs all key events (clicks, sessions, quiz, offer, scroll, conversions)

✅ All federation routes secured via .env API token (no hardcoded tokens)

📦 Modular File System & Features
✅ QuizEngine.tsx handles AI tool recommendation quiz with redirect + scoring

✅ OfferManager.ts renders dynamic, cloaked affiliate offers (rotating via config/CTR)

✅ AnalyticsClient.ts captures and reports frontend events

✅ ConfigSync.ts hot-loads config from orchestrator endpoint

✅ ToolDirectory.tsx dynamically filters and displays AI tools

✅ SelfEvolveAgent.ts handles A/B testing, rollback logic, and experiment injection

✅ LeadMagnetFlow.tsx captures leads via gated content (PDFs, toolkits, templates)

✅ ExportManager.ts allows export of config + content into .neuron.json

🧠 AI + Personalization
✅ User archetypes are detected and stored (e.g., Creator, Explorer, Researcher)

✅ Quiz results + past sessions feed into tool recommendations

✅ Emotion-mapped UI adjusts per archetype (layout, theme, CTA tone)

✅ AI generates or curates new blog/tutorial content (OpenAI or internal agent)

✅ Offers are personalized or reordered via orchestrator experiment rules

🔄 Self-Evolving Logic
✅ A/B testing engine adjusts hero layouts, offer order, CTAs based on data

✅ Underperforming content (CTR < threshold) triggers auto-removal or demotion

✅ Fallback triggers fire if:

API failure > 2x in 1 min

CTR drops > 40% in 3 hrs

Offer click rate < 0.5%

✅ SelfEvolveAgent logs recovery events and syncs to orchestrator

💰 Affiliate Offer System
✅ Offers are pulled from offers.json or API

✅ All links are cloaked via /redirect?offer=xyz

✅ Clicks/conversions tracked via /api/analytics/report

✅ Offers are auto-rotated based on performance (CTR or payout)

📚 Content Stack
✅ 100+ tools listed with fields: name, platform, category, price, features, rating

✅ 50+ SEO-focused blog posts/articles on AI tools, use cases, guides

✅ Tool comparison tables, carousels, and filter modules implemented

✅ Content is served from Markdown, CMS, or .json directory structure

🧱 Scalability & Modularity
✅ Fully cloneable into related niches (neuron-prompts, neuron-ai-design, etc.)

✅ No hardcoded values (all config/env driven)

✅ Config and offers are modular, replaceable without code changes

✅ README.md documents how to extend and scale the app

📈 Analytics + Logs
✅ All pages, scrolls, clicks, form fills are logged

✅ Logs are synced and exportable

✅ Self-healing logic activates on anomaly detection

✅ Performance metrics (LCP, bounce, time on page) are tracked

📜 README & Documentation
✅ README.md is updated with project purpose, module map, federation logic

✅ replit.md includes local setup, endpoints, federation sync logic

✅ No new README files created — existing ones updated only

✅ Includes guide for cloning and customizing for other verticals

🔐 Compliance & Security
✅ API keys and tokens stored securely in .env

✅ GDPR/CCPA banners and cookie tracking (where applicable)

✅ All outbound links include affiliate disclaimers

✅ Option for user to opt-out of AI personalization (if required by region)

📤 Export / Import Support
