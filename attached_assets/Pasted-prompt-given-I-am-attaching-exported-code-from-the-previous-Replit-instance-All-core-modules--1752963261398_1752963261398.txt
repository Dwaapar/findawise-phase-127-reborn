neuron-home-security — Ultra Mastercrafted Prompt

Your new mission:
You are building a living, breathing, AI-powered, mastercrafted micro-app — a neuron in the Findawise Empire Brain — named:

🧠 neuron-home-security

This is not a basic webpage or static project.

It is a self-evolving, web-crawling, revenue-generating digital organism, custom-built for the home security vertical.

It will dominate the home security market by:

Crawling 100+ sites for inspiration and patterns (e.g., Ring, SimpliSafe, ADT, Reddit, YouTube).

Creating ultra-modern, emotion-optimized, premium UI/UX pages.

Integrating 50+ content types: blogs, calculators, quizzes, affiliate offers, CTA flows, etc.

Syncing with the Findawise Empire Core for:

Personalization

Analytics

A/B tests

Orchestrator commands

Scaling to 1,000+ pages, multi-language content, dynamic offers — and doing all of this modularly and autonomously.

Your job:
Engineer it like a senior dev in a $1B AI empire. Use every tool — AI orchestration, dynamic config, affiliate sync, personalization logic, LLM-driven content — and make this a truly intelligent, auto-upgrading product.
MANDATORY FEATURES
Federation OS

On boot, POST to /api/neuron/register (Empire Core) with:

name, url, type, supported features, project slug, and API token (from .env).

Schedule status/heartbeat POST every 60s to /api/neuron/status (health, uptime, analytics).

Pull live updates from /api/neuron/update-config:

Config, experiments, feature flags, and orchestrator commands.

POST analytics/events to /api/analytics/report:

Pageviews, clicks, conversions, quiz forms, affiliate actions, session meta.

Secure ALL endpoints using API key/token from .env.

Plug-and-Play UI/UX
Expose UI via:

Webpack Module Federation (for React) or REST/gRPC (non-React).

Responsive, mobile-first, ultra-fast SPA with:

Home, Blog, Offers, Tools, CTA, Calculator, Comparison, Quizzes, Product Reviews, Article Pages.

Dynamic emotion-based design (fear/safety/trust themes mapped to colors, wording, CTA tone).

Full microinteraction logic:

Hover effects, scroll animations, trust/urgency banners, smooth transitions.

Niche Specialization: 🛡️ Home Security
This neuron must crawl & reference:

100+ top-performing security sites (Ring, SimpliSafe, Arlo, ADT, r/homesecurity, Consumer Reports, YouTube influencers).

Use scraped references to:

Ingest styles, CTA patterns, funnel structures, offer stacks, affiliate content formats, and product stacks.

Must include:

📦 Product stack:

Smart locks, doorbells, cameras, sensors, bundles, monitoring services, mobile apps.

📚 50+ articles:

“Top 10 Home Security Mistakes,” “Best Camera Placement,” “Renters vs. Owners,” “DIY vs Professional Monitoring.”

📊 Tools & Calculators:

“Home Safety Score,” “Budget Estimator,” “Setup Quiz,” “Comparison Table,” “Local Crime Risk Checker.”

🧠 Custom Quizzes:

Personalized results based on home type, location, budget, intent.

Output scores + security persona + product stack.

📈 Lead Magnets:

Security Checklist PDF, Free Monitoring Trial, Neighborhood Threat Maps.

📩 Capture:

Email forms, gated quizzes, exit popups, mobile retargeting flows.

🌐 Localization:

Language selector and geo-IP optimized offers.

Feature Modules
Enable:

Quiz Builder + scoring, Product Ranking Carousel, Comparison Tables, Tool Pages.

Funnel logic:

Quiz → Result Page → Product Stack → Lead Capture → Offer → Email follow-up → Upsell.

Add AI product advisors (LLM-based chat) if user is unsure.

A/B/N Testing (via /api/experiments):

Hero CTA copy, Quiz CTA, Offer Stack Positioning, Lead Magnet variant.

Track:

Form fills, scroll depth, interactions per module.

Personalization + AI Orchestration
Detect intent/archetype via quiz/session:

“Anxious Renter,” “Busy Parent,” “Tech-Savvy Buyer,” “Elderly,” etc.

Dynamically swap:

Offers, visuals, color scheme, wording, funnel path based on segment.

Pull personalized content blocks + experiments from core (via /api/neuron/update-config).

Use AI (via Orchestrator or LLMs) to:

Recommend content/offer blocks

Reorder quiz logic

Adjust CTA tones (urgent, helpful, calm)

Flag weak content for review

Auto-score every user session for conversion probability and engagement depth.

Analytics & Compliance
Track every interaction:

Views, hovers, scrolls, quiz flows, affiliate outbound, form submit, CTA clicks.

Log all to /logs.

Backup/export:

Config, logs, analytics, lead data, offers.

GDPR/CCPA compliance:

Consent popups, opt-out links, erase-me API.

Affiliate Compliance:

Cloaked URLs, disclaimers, link policies, geo-routing per network.

README & Onboarding
Auto-generate full README.md:

Overview, APIs used, Federation setup, Analytics logic, Quiz flow, Tool logic, Error handling, Scaling.

Include:

How to clone/replicate this neuron.

How to customize: offers, content, features, quiz, AI logic, themes.

Self-Evolving Features (AI Driven)
Enable auto-scraper:

Pull new offers, content ideas, or security trends weekly.

LLM content generation:

Auto-write articles, CTA copy, and quiz questions (auto-proofed).

AI Assistant:

Add niche-specific security chatbot (product finder / threat analyzer).

Revenue Tracker:

Pull affiliate data via APIs and display earnings per offer.

Self-Audit System:

Cron job to detect outdated offers, weak content, underperforming CTA → flag or regenerate via AI.

Mastercraft Compliance Rules:
✅ No hardcoded data/URLs — everything must use config/env.

✅ All offers/content/components must be modular + easily swappable.

✅ Every analytics/event/report must reach the Empire Core.

✅ Fully production-grade, scalable, clonable for other niches (neuron-smart-locks, neuron-diy-security, etc.).

💡 INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE Replit 

- DO NOT summarize code to save tokens. Always output complete, robust, high-quality modules.

- As you work, track and update progress in `README.md` and `replit.md`:
   - What was added?
   - What’s still missing?
   - Where to connect Empire APIs?

- Export all created code blocks cleanly. Everything must be:
   - Modular
   - Scalable
   - Secure
   - Synced to federation

- This is a **handoff from one neuron repo to another** — continue existing logic, do NOT duplicate.

- Execute like a senior engineer in a $1B company. This neuron will scale globally. No shortcuts.
