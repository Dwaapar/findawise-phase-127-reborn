Verify that all components of neuron-health-and-wellness have been implemented correctly, in alignment with the Federation Bridge rollout.

Federation OS (Empire Core Sync)

Has /api/neuron/register been correctly POSTed with the required metadata: name, slug, URL, type, supported features, token?

Is /api/neuron/status sending the correct heartbeat every 60 seconds (CPU/memory usage, user sessions, error logs)?

Is /api/neuron/update-config syncing correctly with the latest orchestration, feature toggles, experiments, and LLM prompt injection rules?

Are all analytics being sent to /api/analytics/report as specified (page views, CTA clicks, form submits, etc.)?

Are all endpoints secured with an API token and rate-limiting rules?

UI/UX Design

Has the UI been built as Webpack Module Federation remote or REST/gRPC APIs?

Is the UI emotion-mapped (calm, energetic, trustworthy, playful) with appropriate color modes and archetype overlays?

Are all micro-interactions (scroll parallax, fluid transitions, animated metrics) implemented?

Content & Offer Engine

Has the content been curated correctly (100+ articles, 20+ lead magnets, dynamic affiliate offers)?

Are the content sources properly crawled and ingested from primary and secondary sources?

Is the content auto-rotating via configuration (affiliate offers, tool features, etc.) with geo/intent-based routing?

Personalization & AI Logic

Are user archetypes (e.g., “The Sleepless Pro”) detected from quizzes or session behavior?

Are CTAs, colors, tools, and offers dynamically adapting based on archetypes and behavior?

Are LLM functions operating as expected (article generation, quiz suggestions, content validation)?

Is the self-healing feature working for underperforming content (AI-enhanced rewrite)?

Tools, Quizzes, & Gamification

Are quizzes ("Which Wellness Persona Are You?", "Best Diet for You", etc.) functioning and returning correct results, offers, and suggested trackers?

Are the calculators (BMI, BMR, Sleep Debt, etc.) capturing sessions and emitting analytics?

Are gamification features like daily quests, XP, streaks, and leaderboards working correctly?

Analytics, Experiments, A/B

Are analytics events being sent correctly (tool opens, quiz answers, scroll depth)?

Are A/B/N experiments running for CTA text, quiz phrasing, offer stacks, and form layouts?

Are conversion rates being tracked per archetype and abandoned quiz rates being logged?

Security, Compliance, Logs

Is the consent banner functioning across multiple languages, and GDPR opt-out ("Erase Me") implemented?

Are cookies, affiliate disclaimers, and API tokens properly handled?

Are all errors logged to /logs and exported to the Core, with uptime monitoring and fallback config?

Documentation Sync

Has README.md and replit.md been updated correctly with the required details (project name, slug, endpoints, analytics map, tool behavior, and customization instructions)?

Is the list of completed tasks and pending tasks clearly outlined?

Scaling Strategy

Are 50–200 emotion-adaptive pages generated based on user archetypes?

Is the cloning logic functioning to create new neurons (e.g., neuron-diet-plans, neuron-fitness-beginners)?

Are all sub-pages syncing correctly with the central federation?

Ensure that each feature is properly implemented and all necessary synchronization with the Empire Core is occurring. Flag any missing or incomplete elements and recommend specific fixes or enhancements.
