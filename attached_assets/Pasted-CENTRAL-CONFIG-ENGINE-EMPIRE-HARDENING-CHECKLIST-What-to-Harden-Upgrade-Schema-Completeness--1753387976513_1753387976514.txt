CENTRAL CONFIG ENGINE — EMPIRE HARDENING CHECKLIST
What to Harden / Upgrade:
Schema Completeness

Every property must be defined for every page, niche, emotion, module, CTA, SEO, etc.

Use TypeScript interfaces/types to enforce structure and catch future errors.

Add version field for config (helps with migrations and rollbacks).

Meta Expansion (Future-Proof)

Add fields for:

vertical, locale, userPersona, intentCluster

layoutType, featureFlags, a/bTestVariant

lastUpdated, deprecated, author, notes

Reserve space for future modules: RAG, RLHF, MemoryGraph, etc.

Validation & Testing

Implement runtime schema validation (Zod, Joi, or custom logic)

Add test cases: every new config should be validated before deploy.

Security & Compliance

Sanitize ALL dynamic fields — especially those rendered in UI

Mask/strip sensitive keys before exposing to frontend or exporting

Access control on who can read/write/update config in admin

Dynamic Import/Export

Export/import logic for config chunks

API endpoints for partial updates, backups, rollbacks, and diffs

Change Logging & Versioning

Every change logs who/when/what changed

Store snapshots/history for quick rollback

Diff viewer in admin UI

Federation-Ready

Make it easy for each neuron (module/micro-app) to subscribe to only its relevant config chunk

Core can broadcast updates, but each neuron can override locally if needed

Performance

Split config files by vertical, region, or module if size gets big

Support lazy loading or streaming config

README.md & Docs

Add diagrams, sample config, expected schema/types, validation rules

“How to extend/upgrade” section for future devs

Clear instructions on rolling back, diffing, or recovering config

Bonus: AI/LLM Compatibility

Reserve optional fields for LLM prompt snippets, RAG context, AI assist metadata

Add tags for training future local AI on page configs


make sure these done--

Harden the Central Config Engine to “Empire Grade” by:

Enforcing complete, type-safe, and versioned config schemas

Adding support for all future module integrations (RAG, RLHF, AI, etc.)

Implementing strict validation, logging, rollback, and access control

Making the config federation-ready for distributed neurons/micro-apps

Optimizing for performance, modularity, and security

Auto-generating a full README with schema, sample config, validation/testing instructions, extension/upgrade guide, and migration/rollback flow
