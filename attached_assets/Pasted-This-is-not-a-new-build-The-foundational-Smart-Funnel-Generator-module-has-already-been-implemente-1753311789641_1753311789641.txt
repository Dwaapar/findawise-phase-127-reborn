This is not a new build.
The foundational Smart Funnel Generator module has already been implemented earlier with key components like quiz builder, offer stack generator, lead capture, and retarget logic.You must treat this prompt as a direct evolution of the previously built module — building on top of existing components, not replacing them.
Focus on refactoring, upgrading, and layering intelligence and orchestration, while maintaining all previously functional components and integrations.
This serves as a strategic upgrade to that existing system.
It enhances the previous version by adding advanced, AI-native capabilities:



Smart Funnel Generator — Automated, Multi-Step Conversion Engine (Self-Evolving, Intent-Aware, Personalization-Driven)

🎯 Objective:
Build a dynamic, data-driven funnel system that intelligently orchestrates every user’s path—from entry point to best offer, lead magnet, upsell, and post-conversion actions—adapting in real time based on user intent, persona, and analytics feedback.

---

⚡️ 1. Funnel Definition & Config
- Define funnel templates as modular JSON (or DB-driven) configs:
    - Entry triggers (quiz, blog, CTA click, search, ad, etc.)
    - Step sequence (quiz → result → offer → lead magnet → upsell → cross-sell → referral)
    - Branching logic: based on persona, intent, score, behavior, A/B test variant
    - End conditions: conversion, bounce, opt-out, loop, nurture

- Must support: multiple verticals, dynamic cloning, quick edits

---

🧠 2. Funnel Engine (Orchestration + Adaptation)
- Detects entry context: traffic source, persona, device, session state
- Auto-selects best funnel template & variant for the user
- Real-time adaptation: moves user forward/back, skips steps, fast-tracks if user is high-intent
- Funnels can re-enter at any point (no “dead ends”)

- Supports both server-driven and client-driven orchestration for optimal UX and analytics

---

🎯 3. Dynamic Step Components
- Each step (quiz, offer stack, lead form, upsell, thank you, referral) is a plug-and-play module:
    - Quiz engine auto-syncs results and passes to offers
    - Offer blocks adapt to quiz/persona/context
    - Lead magnet forms with adaptive CTAs and anti-spam logic
    - Upsell/cross-sell modules tied to conversion data
    - Referral triggers (share, invite, reward, review)

---

📊 4. Funnel Analytics + AI Optimization
- Logs every step, drop-off, conversion, step time, variant performance
- Feeds data to AI/Orchestrator for auto-funnel improvement:
    - Reorders steps for highest LTV
    - Flags bottlenecks, poor-converting modules
    - Auto-suggests new funnels based on market/analytics changes

---

🔄 5. User Memory & Funnel Resume
- Each user/session stores funnel progress, intent score, journey map
- On return (any device), resume funnel from last step
- Remind/engage via notification/email if user drops out mid-funnel

---

🔗 6. Federation & Integration
- Neurons/modules can trigger, join, or continue funnels
- Supports API hooks: start/advance/resume funnel, log step, get suggestions, etc.

---

🧪 7. Simulation, QA & Testing Tools
- Simulate user journeys, edge cases, multi-persona/variant flows
- Auto-generate test cases for new funnels, steps, and integrations

---

🔒 8. Security, Privacy, Compliance
- Full consent tracking, opt-out logic, GDPR/CCPA compliance
- All funnel data securely logged and auditable

---

📘 9. README (MANDATORY)
- Full docs: funnel config, orchestration logic, step/component design, analytics hooks, federation APIs, QA/sim tools
- Setup guide: how to clone, edit, or launch new funnels; sample journeys

---
