This is not a new module.
The core 3D/AR/VR CTA engine has already been built earlier.

This prompt is a complete upgrade‚Äîadding cross-platform fallback, deeper real-time personalization, emotion/context detection, immersive video, headset support, and developer simulation tools.

Focus on evolving the existing system, not duplicating it.
This version makes the CTA engine production-ready for mobile, VR, low-end devices, and AI-powered personalization.

AR/VR/3D CTA Renderer ‚Äî Immersive, Multi-Platform Conversion Engine (Web, Mobile, Future-Ready)

üéØ Objective:
Build a universal, modular system for rendering high-conversion CTAs in AR, VR, and 3D environments‚Äîacross web, mobile, and edge platforms.

---

üßä 1. CTA Format & Integration
- Support multiple CTA types:
    - 3D product viewers (GLB/GLTF, Three.js, Babylon.js)
    - WebAR overlays (AR.js, 8th Wall, WebXR Device API)
    - VR rooms/spaces (A-Frame, React 360)
    - Immersive video CTAs (360 video, spatial audio cues)
- CTAs are plug-and-play: inject via config, page, or funnel step

- All CTAs dynamically adapt theme, text, and offer based on emotion, persona, or journey context

---

üåê 2. Cross-Platform Compatibility
- Render CTAs natively in:
    - Desktop browsers (WebGL/WebXR)
    - Mobile browsers (iOS/Android, AR Quick Look, Google Scene Viewer)
    - VR headsets (Meta Quest, Pico, browser-based VR)
- Graceful fallback: If AR/VR not available, serve rich 3D or 2D CTA with animation

---

üéõ 3. Interactive CTA Logic
- Track all user interactions:
    - View, rotate, zoom, place in room, customize, share, click, convert
- AI/analytics engine adapts CTA based on user behavior (time in view, engagement score, prior path)
- Supports gamification, rewards, or bonus offers for CTA interaction milestones

---

‚ö° 4. Live Offer Sync & Personalization
- All CTAs pull real-time offers, content, and user memory from the semantic graph and personalization engine
- Show most relevant offers, localized copy, and adaptive imagery/assets

---

üîó 5. Federation + Multi-Neuron Hooks
- Neurons/modules can register new CTA formats, 3D models, AR overlays, or VR scenes
- API to trigger CTA render, log interaction, push offer updates

---

üõ† 6. Developer Tooling & UX Simulation
- Preview/test 3D/AR/VR CTAs in dev mode
- Simulate emotion/persona/journey contexts
- Auto-generate fallback UIs for no-WebXR/old device users

---

üîí 7. Security, Privacy, Compliance
- All assets loaded via secure CDN, checked for vulnerabilities
- No PII captured in 3D/AR/VR scenes without explicit consent
- GDPR/CCPA compliance for all user tracking/interactions

---

üìò 8. README (MANDATORY)
- Docs: supported CTA formats, platform integration, fallback logic, analytics hooks, federation API
- Guide: how to create/integrate a new CTA (3D model, AR scene, VR room)
- Samples: code snippets, sample configs, demo assets

---

üí• Output Requirements:
‚úÖ Multi-format AR/VR/3D CTA engine (modular, pluggable, multi-platform)
‚úÖ Analytics/adaptive engine for CTA optimization
‚úÖ Federation, API, and asset management
‚úÖ Full compliance, fallback, and docs
