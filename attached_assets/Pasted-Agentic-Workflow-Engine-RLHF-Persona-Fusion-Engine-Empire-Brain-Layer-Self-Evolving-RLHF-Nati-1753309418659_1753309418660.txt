Agentic Workflow Engine — RLHF + Persona Fusion Engine
(Empire Brain Layer, Self-Evolving, RLHF-Native, Federation-Synced, Billion-Dollar Ready)

🎯 Objective
Create an adaptive, intelligence-first brain layer for the Findawise Empire that learns continuously from user behavior, agent feedback, and persona evolution—driving smarter UX, optimized LLM routing, and personalized experiences that evolve automatically.

🤖 1. RLHF Feedback Loop Engine
Build a complete reinforcement learning loop using both explicit and implicit signals.

✅ Feedback Capture:
Explicit: thumbs up/down, ratings, surveys, admin approvals

Implicit: scroll depth, clicks, time-on-page, conversions, CTA interactions, quiz exits

✅ Contextual Binding:
Every feedback is tagged with:

Agent ID, prompt version, user session/archetype, timestamp, page path, task type

✅ Reward Scoring Logic:
Score and re-rank:

LLM agents, prompt chains, workflows, offer blocks, content formats, UX patterns

Schedule adaptive updates:

Real-time streaming or batched retraining

Reweight routing, prompt injection, or agent selection based on reward trajectory

🧑‍💼 2. Persona Fusion Engine
Continuously learn and evolve user personas across all empire modules.

✅ Persona Creation:
Predefined + emergent archetypes:

Renter, Hustler, Student, Health-Conscious, Passive Income Seeker, etc.

Based on:

Quiz answers, page behaviors, clicked offers, preferred formats, time of use

✅ Fusion Logic:
Score hybrid personas:

e.g., “65% DIY Investor, 35% Tech Minimalist”

Adapt:

Offers, CTAs, colors, tone, layout, and LLM routing accordingly

✅ Auto-Discovery:
Use clustering/unsupervised ML (e.g., k-Means, DBSCAN):

Detect and label new persona types

Track persona drift, trait merging/splitting over time

🧬 3. Admin UI + RLHF Dashboard
Located at /admin/rlhf-brain

✅ Capabilities:
View:

All feedback logs, agent reward trends, persona scores, prompt versioning

Visualize:

Heatmaps of which agents/personas perform best across offers or verticals

Manage:

Override reward logic

Retrain prompts or workflows

Split/Merge personas

🔗 4. Federation + Data Hooks
Full support for a federated intelligence loop across all empire neurons/modules:

✅ Federation Sync:
All neurons/modules can:

Push:

Feedback, persona scoring, session analytics, agent decisions

Pull:

Updated reward scores, fused personas, best-performing agents/prompts

Hooks for:

/api/rlhf/submit, /api/persona/sync, /api/persona/get, /api/agent/rankings

🔒 5. Security, Logging, Governance
All feedback, persona, and agent data are secured and traceable.

✅ Logging:
Versioning for:

Reward updates, prompt diffs, persona scores, agent routing logs

Rollbacks:

Revert changes, block invalid feedback floods

Consent-aware:

All tracking compliant with GDPR, CCPA, and user toggleable

🔁 6. Add-On Upgrades (MANDATORY)
6A. 🔁 Feedback Weight Adjuster
Signal hierarchy (most to least reliable):

✅ Conversion > Quiz Completion > Scroll > Dwell > Click > Explicit Thumb

Apply smart decay over time

Bot/noise filter auto-flags anomalies

6B. 🧪 Persona Simulation Mode
Run simulation as hybrid persona:

Preview routing, CTA, layout, tone, offers

Dev/testing UX view for developers and researchers

6C. 📊 Evolution Diff Engine
Tracks:

Prompt performance shifts

Persona drifts

Agent improvement/decline

Alerts if changes regress performance

6D. 🧠 Federated RLHF Loop
Each neuron/module can:

Locally score and retrain

Push summaries to Core RLHF Brain

Empire scales like a swarm—local intelligence + central alignment

📘 7. README (MANDATORY)
Must include:

Setup: feedback collection, scoring weights, persona scoring algorithm

Federation: API hooks, push/pull logic

Admin UI overview

Clustering logic (auto-discovery)

Persona UX override guide

RLHF loop examples (agent → feedback → reward → routing update)

Sample logs, persona configs, diff heatmaps
