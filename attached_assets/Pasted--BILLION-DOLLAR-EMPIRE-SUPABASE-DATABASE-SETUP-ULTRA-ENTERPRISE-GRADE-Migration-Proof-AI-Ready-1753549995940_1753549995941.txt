üíé BILLION DOLLAR EMPIRE SUPABASE DATABASE SETUP ‚Äî ULTRA ENTERPRISE GRADE (Migration-Proof, AI-Ready, Self-Auditing)

Objective  
Design, provision, and integrate a full Supabase/Postgres database for the Findawise Empire.  
Make it **bulletproof** for global scale, AI/ML, analytics, real-time sync, security, and legal compliance.  
All secrets/keys/configs must be migration-proof: **never lost, never leaked, always available across environments.**  
Check for every required table, relationship, trigger, and field ‚Äî and test that all empire modules can fully function.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Project Credentials & Env Setup

- Use **Supabase CLI** or dashboard to create your project if not already done.
- Store all connection info/secrets ONLY in `.env` (never in code, never hardcoded).
  - `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, etc.
- In Replit:
  - Store env vars in Replit‚Äôs Secrets manager (`.env` never checked in).
  - In production/server, use platform env secret manager (AWS, Vercel, etc).
- Include an **automated secrets loader** in your codebase:
  - On start, checks for missing/invalid credentials and aborts if not found.
  - Auto-imports/merges secrets on migration or redeploy.
- Optionally, **create a fallback secrets fetcher** (from a Gist or secure vault) if local env is missing.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Schema Design: Full Empire Tables

Design all core tables (expand as needed):

- `users`: id (uuid), email, anonId, hash, deviceList, sessionTokens, consent, lastSeen, geo, archetype, favorites, meta
- `user_sessions`: session_id, user_id, start, end, device, ip, actions, profile_snapshot, consent_status
- `offers`: id, type, title, slug, url, meta, cta_text, affiliate_network, payout, country, currency, emotion, product_tags, status, expires, etc
- `products`: id, type, title, details, offer_id, price, features, reviews, meta, status
- `blogs`: id, slug, title, content, author, meta, tags, vector_embedding, emotion, created_at, updated_at
- `quizzes`: id, slug, title, questions, answers, logic, personalization_map, meta, last_used
- `quiz_results`: id, quiz_id, user_id/session_id, score, answers, archetype, product_stack, created_at
- `analytics_events`: id, user_id/session_id, event_type, meta, path, timestamp, referrer, device, conversion_value, etc
- `consent_logs`: id, user_id, session_id, action, value, timestamp, ip, geo, source
- `affiliate_clicks`: id, offer_id, user_id/session_id, timestamp, payout, cookie, ip, geo
- `purchases`: id, user_id, product_id, offer_id, amount, method, license, status, created_at
- `license_keys`: id, user_id, product_id, license_key, expires, status, usage_logs
- `persona_profiles`: id, user_id/session_id, persona_tags, fusion_scores, feedback, updated_at
- `rlhf_feedback`: id, user_id/session_id, agent_id, signal, value, target, timestamp, meta
- `memory_nodes`: id, type, slug, content, vector_embedding, meta, source, usage_score, version, created_at, updated_at
- `federation_neurons`: id, name, type, url, api_key, status, last_seen, feature_flags
- `admin_logs`: id, action, actor_id, meta, before, after, timestamp, ip

**Add all other tables for any module above (including: notifications, funnel steps, payout logs, translations, AB tests, error_logs, etc.)**

**Every table must include:**
- Created_at, updated_at
- `meta` JSONB field for extensibility
- Foreign key relationships
- Indices for all high-read fields
- Unique constraints for slugs, ids, emails, etc.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Migration & Self-Healing

- Use Supabase **migrations**: each schema change is tracked, reversible, and tested on staging before prod.
- Include a **migration-checker** in your code:
  - On startup, runs a check for missing tables/fields/indices.  
  - If missing, triggers a migration script, logs issues, and emails/admin alerts.
- Add automated backup/restore scripts for local/dev/prod environments.
- Build **DB health dashboard**:  
  - Exposes `/admin/db-health` endpoint with table row counts, index stats, migration status, error logs.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Integration: Data API & Logic

- Create an internal **DB API Layer** (TypeScript/Node):
  - All read/write/update/delete actions go through a DB service, not scattered in code
  - Include data validation, access control, field/type checks, and security logging
  - Fails gracefully if any table/field is missing (shows error, does NOT corrupt data)
- **Realtime:** Enable Supabase Realtime for events/changes (user updates, offer sync, quiz results)
- **Federation:** All cross-neuron/module data must use DB API (never raw SQL in modules)
- All admin actions logged, all errors reported

5Ô∏è‚É£ AI/ML & Analytics Ready

- All tables built for vector search, AI/ML, prompt storage, embeddings, RAG, clustering, AB/n testing
- Built-in analytics tables: queries, conversions, split tests, click funnels
- Data export endpoints for LLM fine-tuning or offline ML pipelines
