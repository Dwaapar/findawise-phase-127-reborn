Notification + Email Lifecycle Engine (Genius-Ready, AI-Driven, Cross-Channel)

🎯 Core Objective:
Build a full-scale, cross-channel notification engine that powers intelligent engagement via email, push, SMS, WhatsApp, and in-app alerts — all dynamically triggered and personalized based on user behavior, semantic intent, and AI optimization.

🔩 1. Multi-Channel Communication Layer
Integrate natively with:

Email: Resend, Sendgrid, SMTP fallback, Postmark (plug-and-play modules)

Web Push: FCM, OneSignal, service workers

SMS/WhatsApp: Twilio, Vonage, fallback logic (SMS if WhatsApp fails)

In-App Notifications: Bell UI, PWA toast system, mobile-ready

Future Expansion: Modular system for Discord, Telegram, Slack, or custom channels

⚡️ 2. Behavior-Based Trigger Engine
Support real-time, delayed, and drip campaigns triggered by:

New user/signup/lead capture

Quiz abandoned, product view abandoned, form dropout

New blog/article, updated offer, best-deal detection

Engagement milestone (nth visit, X mins on site, user LTV rise)

AI-generated events (high bounce risk, price-watch alert)

Manual admin events (from dashboard or external API)

🔗 3. Personalization & AI Logic
All notifications must:

Use dynamic personalization variables: name, device, emotion, recent action, segment, LTV, intent vector

Pull content from semantic graph, user profile, and AI-optimized content blocks

Support:

Subject line A/B testing

Content variant rotation (per segment)

Channel priority logic (AI picks: email → SMS → push, etc.)

🗂 4. Template Management System
Build /admin/notifications-dashboard:

View/edit all templates (email, push, SMS, in-app)

Markdown + variable support + real-user preview

Enable/disable templates per segment/country/locale

Logs: send history, errors, feedback loops

📈 5. Analytics + Reporting
Track full lifecycle:

Sent → Delivered → Opened → Clicked → Conversion

Heatmaps, time-to-open, dropoff points

Per-user + aggregate analytics (funnel views)

Alerts for low-performing messages or blacklisted keywords

🛡 6. Compliance & Security
Full GDPR/CCPA compliance (opt-out, “erase me”, legal copy)

JWT + RBAC for all admin endpoints

Rate limiting, failover logic (email → SMS if blocked), retry queue

Admin change logs (audit trail for all trigger/template edits)

🤖 7. ML + Auto-Optimizer Hooks (Future-Ready)
Optional AI plugins to:

Predict optimal send time per user/device

Auto-select best channel (AI agent tests SMS vs push)

Subject line & CTA experimentation (real-time learning)

📘 8. README + Scaling Docs
Setup guide: API keys, channel modules, test send, fallback logic

Trigger definitions + examples

Export/import template schema

Cron examples, failover tests, compliance edge cases

Scaling guide: how to handle 10M+ notifications/day

💥 Output & Quality Rules:
No placeholder logic.

All code must be fully working, testable, and modularized.

Admin panel required.

Federation-ready APIs and AI slot integration required.

Final export includes: backend, frontend, sample data, APIs, README.

🧠 Empire Rule:
This notification engine is not an add-on. It is the lifeblood of engagement and monetization. It must work globally, at scale, with AI-grade intelligence and full resilience.
