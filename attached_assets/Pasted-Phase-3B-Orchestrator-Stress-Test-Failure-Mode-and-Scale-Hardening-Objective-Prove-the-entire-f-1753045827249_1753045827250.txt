Phase 3B: Orchestrator Stress Test, Failure Mode, and Scale Hardening

Objective:
Prove the entire federation and dashboard system is bulletproof under load, edge cases, and unexpected failures.

MANDATORY TASKS:
Simulate Scale & Load

Spawn 10–50 mock neurons (use scripts, test data, or containers if needed).

Register all with the core; verify dashboard lists all, with correct health/stats/config.

Trigger bulk config/experiment/AI updates (single neuron, all neurons, random subset).

Track latency and success/failure rates.

Test Failure Modes

Simulate:

Neuron goes offline/unreachable (network down, process kill)

Bad config push (malformed data, unsupported version, security error)

Analytics push fails (API/network broken)

Race conditions: 2 admins push config at once

Core must:

Detect failures within 1 minute (auto-status update)

Retry, alert, and log errors

Rollback config if neuron does not confirm update

NEVER leave the system in partial or corrupted state

Verify Real-Time Data Integrity

All analytics/events must flow from neurons to core and display live in dashboard

No data loss/duplication during network blips, reconnects, or neuron churn

All rollbacks/audit logs update instantly in UI and DB

Harden Security and RBAC

Test all admin roles/permissions (no unauthorized config push or access)

Audit logs record every change/action (admin ID, timestamp, IP, diff)

README.md Update

Document all hardening steps, edge cases, and failure handling.

Add a section: “How to test and scale for 100+ neurons (live or mock)”

Include known issues, mitigation steps, and contact points for ops escalation.

Rules:

No “test only” code in prod—mock logic must be swappable/isolated.

Don’t skip manual edge-case testing (use CLI, network kills, etc).

All failures must be visible and recoverable in the UI.

This is NOT a “nice to have”—it’s required for raising, scaling, and going global.

DELIVERABLES:

Empire dashboard and backend proven at scale (10–50 neurons live/test)

Audit log of all tests, failures, and rollbacks

Final README.md update with full hardening guide and next steps

What you must add:

10–50 mock/test neurons (not just live ones), either spun up as containers, local scripts, or API-mocked.

Test pushes, failures, analytics, and recovery.
