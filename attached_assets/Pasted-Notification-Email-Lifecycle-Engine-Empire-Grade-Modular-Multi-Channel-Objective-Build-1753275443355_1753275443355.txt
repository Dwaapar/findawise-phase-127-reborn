Notification + Email Lifecycle Engine (Empire-Grade, Modular, Multi-Channel)

🎯 Objective:
Build a full notification and email engine that supports multi-step lifecycle messaging across web, email, push, SMS, and in-app—all data-driven and AI-ready.

---

🔔 1. Notification Infrastructure
- Multi-channel support: email, web push, in-app, SMS, WhatsApp (plug-in ready)
- Unified event bus: all user actions (lead, purchase, quiz, offer view, milestone) can trigger notifications or scheduled flows
- Per-user preferences: opt-in/out, frequency, channel, topics (offers, blog, reminders, support, etc.)

---

📧 2. Email Automation Engine
- Drag-and-drop campaign builder in /admin/notifications-dashboard
- Templates for welcome, onboarding, upsell, win-back, abandoned funnel, retarget, broadcast
- AI/LLM-powered copywriting for subject lines, CTAs, and email content
- Split testing (A/B/N) for all campaigns and content

---

⚡️ 3. Lifecycle Journeys & Sequencing
- Visual journey builder: connect events (e.g., sign-up, quiz complete, purchase) to lifecycle flows (multi-step, conditional)
- Real-time triggers + scheduled sends (hourly, daily, weekly, custom)
- Automated journey re-entry (e.g., user returns after 30 days = win-back flow)
- Smart “cool-down” to prevent spam/over-message

---

📈 4. Analytics, Export & Federation
- Track opens, clicks, conversions, opt-outs, bounce/spam rate
- Analytics dashboard: journey performance, user cohorts, channel breakdown
- Export all journey configs, analytics, and user logs for AI/ML optimization

---

🔐 5. Security & Compliance
- Full double opt-in, unsubscribe, “erase me”, GDPR/CCPA-compliant
- RBAC-secured admin panel, API endpoints, template/export logic

---

📘 6. README (MANDATORY)
- Complete docs: campaign builder, journey builder, event triggers, analytics, compliance, integration with funnel/offer modules, notification API for neurons
- Sample campaign/journey configs, event logs, analytics exports

---

💥 Output Requirements:
- Fully working, modular, exportable notification/email engine
- Live admin panel (campaign/journey builder, analytics), multi-channel API endpoints, logs, README, sample configs
