Project: neuron-education – Online Education & eLearning
You are now creating a self-evolving, AI-driven, modular micro-app called neuron-education.
This neuron is part of the Neuron Federation Bridge inside the Findawise Global Web Empire and will act as an autonomous, AI-powered learning engine — capable of adapting, evolving, and monetizing 1000s of education topics.

🧠 WHAT THIS IS BUILDING:
A fully pluggable, clonable, Empire-integrated neuron for the Online Learning / eLearning niche

Able to be cloned and extended to future niches (like neuron-language, neuron-testprep, neuron-skillshare)

All federation, analytics, orchestrator, and UI modules must be exposed, secure, and dynamically configurable

Strictly update existing README.md and replit.md — no new files

✅ MANDATORY FEDERATION FEATURES
POST /api/neuron/register → Register neuron with name, slug, category, type, token

POST /api/neuron/status every 60s → Send uptime, health, heartbeat, usage snapshot

GET /api/neuron/update-config → Hot-pull orchestrator config, AI experiments, scaling logic

POST /api/analytics/report → Log all user actions (quiz, click, session, tool usage, revenue)

All Federation APIs must be secured with API key/token from .env

🧩 MODULE FILES TO BE IMPLEMENTED
QuizEngine.tsx – Dynamic quiz logic with scoring, offer redirection, and session tracking

ConfigSync.ts – Auto-pull config from /api/neuron/update-config with hot-reload

AnalyticsClient.ts – Sync all frontend and backend events to Empire analytics endpoint

ContentFetcher.ts – Auto-scrape/crawl 3rd party edu/blog sources for new content

OfferLoader.ts – Pulls dynamic affiliate deals via API or local config

ArchetypeEngine.ts – Detects user type (student, career switcher, hobbyist) and adapts

AIAssistant.tsx – Embedded AI chatbot for real-time learning, FAQs, navigation

🧠 SELF-EVOLVING AI FEATURES
A/B Testing Engine: Auto-switch CTA layouts, hero content, offer order, and track ROI

Orchestrator Agent: Pull experiment logic from Empire Core and apply real-time changes

Underperformance Monitor: Track bounce rate, CTR, time-on-page → trigger rollbackConfig()

LLM Tutor: GPT agent answers questions and nudges users toward next steps

Auto Content Generator: Daily generate new blog/tutorials with AI (format: .md or content.json)

🧱 PLUGGABLE CONTENT STRUCTURE
All offers stored in offers.json or dynamic API pull → fields: { title, tag, price, cta, trackingUrl }

Articles: Markdown/MDX format, hot-loadable from local dir (/content/articles/) or CMS/API

Tools: Each tool (BMI calc, course finder) in its own component: tools/ToolName.tsx

Quizzes: Defined in quizzes/config.json + logic in QuizEngine.tsx

🔐 AFFILIATE SYSTEM
All affiliate links must be cloaked via redirect engine (/redirect?offer=xyz)

Links tracked for click-through + conversion via analytics /report

Offers can be auto-rotated based on CTR or payout score from orchestrator

🌍 NICHE CONTENT + MONETIZATION
100+ SEO-rich blog/tutorials (e.g., Learn Python, Master SAT, Study Hacks, Language Learning)

Product stack: Coursera, Udemy, Skillshare, apps, AI tools, certifications

Lead magnets: Study calendars, goal planners, eBooks, checklists, quiz funnels

Personal learning maps with XP, streaks, badges, goal setting

Quizzes: “What’s Your Study Style?” → routes to personalized page

AI tutor embedded on key pages with subject-specific modules

💡 EMOTION-THEMED UI MODES
Empower: Goal-driven, focused UX for career-switchers

Curious: Playful, discovery-driven flow for hobby learners

Disciplined: Minimal, clean, structured path for exam-takers

Inclusive: Multi-language, ADA-accessible, multi-device adaptive

🎮 GAMIFICATION
XP, skill tree tracker, lesson unlock system

Leaderboards (local, global, friend-based)

Daily “brain quests” → e.g., Read 2 articles + complete a quiz

Streak logic + motivational nudges

Rewards engine to unlock discounts, PDFs, secret guides

🧾 EXPORT / IMPORT SUPPORT
All config must be exportable in .neuron.json

Content in content/articles/*.md, offers.json, quizzes/*.json

Ability to re-import config via /api/neuron/load-config or local load

📈 ANALYTICS + LOGGING
Every route logs scroll, clicks, conversions, time spent

Self-healing engine triggers rollback if:

40% drop in CTR within 3 hours

5 API failures in 10 mins

LCP > 4s for 10% of users

Orchestrator sets thresholds via /api/neuron/update-config

📚 README & REPLIT.MD INSTRUCTIONS (MANDATORY)
Update existing README.md and replit.md, do not create new files

Must include:

Setup, endpoints, federation usage

How to scale/clone to neuron-language, neuron-testprep, etc.

Full file/module map + how to extend

AI logic map (quizzes, tutor, optimizer)

Federation heartbeat flow

How to update config, content, offers

📎 FINAL RULES
Use .env, config.json, offers.json, and .neuron.json for all settings

No hardcoded URLs, tokens, or copy-pasted values

All features must be modular, tracked, and federation-compliant

Every event or user interaction must be trackable by Empire Brain
