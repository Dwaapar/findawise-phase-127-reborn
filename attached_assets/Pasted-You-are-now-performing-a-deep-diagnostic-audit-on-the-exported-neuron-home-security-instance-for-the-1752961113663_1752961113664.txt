You are now performing a deep diagnostic audit on the exported neuron-home-security instance for the Findawise Empire.

Your job is to validate every major module, logic, and feature listed below ‚Äî and identify exactly what is ‚úÖ implemented, ‚ùå missing, or ‚ö†Ô∏è incomplete.

This is NOT a normal audit. This neuron is a self-evolving, AI-powered web organism that must:
- Crawl the web
- Generate content
- Handle AI logic, quizzes, offers, experiments, events, personalization
- Be fully modular, production-grade, and federated into the Empire Brain
