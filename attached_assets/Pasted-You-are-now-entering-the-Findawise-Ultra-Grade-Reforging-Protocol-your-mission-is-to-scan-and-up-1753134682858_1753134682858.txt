You are now entering the "Findawise Ultra-Grade Reforging Protocol" ‚Äî your mission is to scan and upgrade the entire AI-powered, modular, federated empire project called Findawise. 

You MUST NOT skip or delete anything ‚Äî but you MUST UPGRADE every module, config, and neuron to full production-quality logic.

This project already has:
- 11 Empire Modules (page generator, content engine, affiliate logic, personalization, leads, analytics, orchestrator, etc.)
- Federation Bridge (core + 10+ UI and API-only neurons)
- Admin Dashboards, Real-time Sync, Config-driven Architecture
- Central Orchestrator, Multi-language, A/B testing, ML insights, and more

YOUR GOAL IS TO:
1. üîç **Scan every single module, config, and connection**
2. üõ†Ô∏è **Identify and list every single weakness**, including:
    - Placeholder logic
    - Boilerplate code
    - Skipped edge cases
    - Hardcoded offers or themes
    - Broken or missing integrations
    - Missing security, JWT, auth, or GDPR safeguards
    - Missing emotionMap or personalization coverage
    - Missing federation handshake (heartbeat, config, analytics)
    - Weak admin dashboards (fake data, no controls)
3. üöÄ **For every weakness found, UPGRADE the actual logic**:
    - Replace demo modules with real working logic
    - Add production-grade database logic (Replit DB / PostgreSQL stubs)
    - Add working admin control buttons, toggles, config changers
    - Add working A/B logic that persists per session
    - Add actual lead-saving, email capture, validation, and export systems
    - Ensure all analytics events (clicks, impressions, scroll, session) flow to backend
    - Ensure orchestrator actually updates config and stores versioned backups
    - Make AI/ML orchestrator run with real training data from stored analytics
    - Make LLM suggestion engine generate real markdown changelogs, config diffs, and push suggestions to dashboard

4. üìú **Output must include**:
    - ‚úÖ Full Audit Report of modules 1 to 11
    - ‚úÖ Full Audit Report of Federation Core and all neurons
    - ‚úÖ Per-module weakness detection + upgrade plan
    - ‚úÖ Updated code samples with **real logic** (not boilerplate)
    - ‚úÖ Upgraded README.md sections (clear setup, usage, security, extension)
    - ‚úÖ Security Review: API keys, federation tokens, user privacy, session integrity
    - ‚úÖ Admin Dashboard Upgrade Plan: real-time stats, control buttons, event logs
    - ‚úÖ Real config diff engine + rollback/undo logic
    - ‚úÖ Real backup, logging, and changelog systems
    - ‚úÖ Real session-based personalization per archetype/user behavior
    - ‚úÖ Working UI + API neurons showing live federation (register, heartbeat, analytics)

5. üîê **Security Expectations**:
    - No endpoint should be unprotected
    - No data should flow without logging
    - Federation keys or JWT should be enforced in all neuron ‚Üî core interactions

6. üìà **End Result Must Achieve**:
    - 100/100 Production Readiness across ALL modules
    - Zero placeholders, zero skipped integrations
    - Real AI-driven, ML-supported, config-rewriting loop
    - Clean file structure, zero dead code, zero unreferenced assets
    - All federation working end-to-end across UI + API neurons
    - Every module tested to real deployment logic, not just frontend simulation

7. üí° **Your Job**:
    - Scan, audit, refactor, rewrite, replace, document
    - NEVER delete a module
    - ALWAYS upgrade to final working logic
    - If anything is marked TODO or fake ‚Äî build the real logic for it
    - Every user, session, config, neuron, and analytic should connect as a full web of intelligence

You are not auditing a blog or app ‚Äî you are **reforging the brain and nervous system of a trillion-dollar AI-powered empire**.

This project must:
- Learn.
- Optimize itself.
- Understand every user.
- Generate content dynamically.
- Monetize based on behavior.
- Scale across 100s of neurons.
- Federate across stacks (React, Python, API).
- Track, improve, and undo itself.

Act accordingly. Output everything, fix everything. Leave no weakness alive.
