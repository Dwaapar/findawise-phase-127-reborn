Offline AI Sync Engine — Edge AI + Device Resilience (PWA/Offline Empire-Ready)

🎯 Objective:
Build a self-resilient engine that empowers every user, agent, and neuron to run locally, work offline, and automatically sync all content, analytics, personalization, and AI logic as soon as connectivity returns.

---

🚀 1. Offline/Edge AI Capabilities
- Enable core AI/UX features to run on-device:
    - Personalized content recommendations
    - Quiz logic, scoring, and results storage
    - Offer display and interaction tracking
    - Lead magnet delivery (PDF, email, etc.)
    - Blog/article browsing with full emotion/semantic mapping

- All code must gracefully degrade (no blank screens) and recover state when back online

---

📦 2. Full Local Storage & Sync Engine
- Every page, quiz, offer, user profile, and analytics event is stored locally (IndexedDB, SQLite, or PWA storage)
- Sync engine queues all mutations/events when offline
- On reconnect, engine:
    - Replays queued actions/analytics to server
    - Resolves conflicts with server (version, last-write-wins or merge)
    - Pulls new offers/content/experiments missed while offline

---

🧠 3. Lightweight On-Device AI Models
- Use local/edge ML for:
    - Simple recommendation (collaborative filtering, rules, pre-trained TensorFlow.js/ONNX models)
    - Lead scoring, intent detection, basic summarization
    - Flagging stale/irrelevant content when offline (for later batch update)
- Modular so “heavier” models (LLMs, agents) can be plugged in later

---

🌍 4. PWA/Installable App Support
- Must support:
    - Install to device/home screen
    - Offline-first UX (pages, quizzes, offers, blogs, CTAs load from cache)
    - Push notifications and background sync
    - Deep-linking, re-engagement, and periodic updates

---

🔗 5. Federation-Aware, Multi-Device Sync
- Any offline activity is tied to anonymized user/session/device ID
- Sync logic must de-duplicate and merge events across devices when online
- Support for federation hooks so offline neurons/modules can push data to the Empire Core

---

🧩 6. Developer/QA Simulation Mode
- Simulate poor or no connectivity, local-only state, data merge conflicts, forced sync errors
- Debug logs for all sync/resume, errors, and recovery

---

🔒 7. Security, Privacy, Compliance
- All local data is encrypted (AES/ChaCha20)
- Local-only state must respect consent, erase-me, and privacy toggles
- Full audit of offline events, sync, and conflicts

---

📘 8. README (MANDATORY)
- Full docs: offline sync, local model integration, federation merge, conflict handling, security/privacy
- Setup guide for PWA, install, and test

---

✅ Complete offline sync engine (mutation queue, replay, conflict resolution)
✅ Modular on-device AI (recommendation, scoring, intent)
✅ PWA/Installable support
✅ Federation-ready, multi-device sync
✅ Security, compliance, and docs
✅ Simulation/testing tools
