AR/VR/3D CTA Renderer (Empire-Grade, Cross-Platform, Modular)

🎯 Objective:
Build a cross-platform, fully modular engine for rendering 3D/AR/VR call-to-action experiences on any page, offer, or product.

---

🌀 1. Core Rendering Engine
- Integrate Three.js (web), Babylon.js, or A-Frame for 3D rendering
- WebAR support (AR.js, 8th Wall, or Google Scene Viewer for mobile)
- Modular CTA “block” structure: can drop 3D/AR offers, product previews, interactive games, immersive quizzes anywhere

---

🎯 2. Interactive CTA Library
- Prebuilt templates: 
    - 3D product “spin & view”
    - AR try-on (glasses, hats, watches, etc.)
    - Gamified CTA (spin wheel, “break to unlock,” treasure hunt)
    - VR walkthrough/virtual showroom
- Customizable themes, branding, dynamic text/offers

---

⚡️ 3. Integration & Personalization
- Context-aware: auto-match 3D/AR CTA to user intent, page, or quiz result (pulls from semantic/intent graph)
- Personalized offers/visuals based on segment, persona, location, or activity
- Triggered via scroll, click, quiz, timer, or notification

---

📈 4. Analytics & A/B Testing
- Track engagement, completion, conversions, dwell time for each CTA
- Built-in split-testing and journey analytics
- Export all data for AI/ML, optimization, and reporting

---

🧠 5. Admin Dashboard & Live Editor
- /admin/cta-3d-dashboard: select templates, upload 3D models, edit themes/logic, preview, set targeting, schedule launches
- Instant preview and live updates

---

🔗 6. Federation, API, and Scaling
- Federation/API hooks for neurons to request/register 3D CTAs
- Ready for PWA/native/mobile—renders everywhere
- Export/import templates, configs, analytics, logs

---

🔐 7. Security & Compliance
- All assets/models scanned for malware/IP violation
- Consent, opt-out, and accessibility (WAVE/ADA) compliance

---

📘 8. README (MANDATORY)
- Full docs: setup, integration, template creation, analytics, security, API/federation, scaling, best practices
- Sample configs, asset pipelines, integration tips

---

💥 Output Requirements:
- Fully working, modular, cross-platform 3D/AR CTA engine
- All templates, admin panel, analytics, API, README, and sample configs exportable
