Phase 6: Empire Brain — AI/ML Centralization Layer

Objective:
Centralize all analytics, ML, experiment, and personalization logic in the empire core.
Every neuron (UI or API-only) pushes analytics, training data, and context to the brain, and receives orchestrated updates, winning strategies, and AI-powered optimizations in real time.

MANDATORY FEATURES:
Unified AI/ML Orchestration Module

/services/ai-ml-orchestrator.ts (or .py/.go/etc.) — pulls in analytics from all neurons, runs daily/cron/real-time learning cycles.

Ranking, scoring, clustering, and segmenting: auto-detect winning offers, content, layouts, CTAs, blog posts, quiz flows, and user archetypes.

Update core config, experiments, emotion maps, and archetype libraries with new ML-driven weights.

Neuron ↔️ Core Data Pipelines

All neurons push:

Clicks, leads, conversions, user journeys, experiment results, feedback, engagement depth, failed events, revenue, etc.

Core aggregates, cleans, and stores data for learning.

Neurons pull new config/experiment/strategy in real time (websocket/REST).

Personalization & Optimization

Core sends per-archetype and per-neuron optimized:

Offer stacks, blog content, quiz logic, emotion themes, layouts, CTA order, email sequence, etc.

Neurons must instantly apply, log, and report back.

LLM/AI Integration

Optional: Call external LLMs (OpenAI, Hugging Face, in-house, etc.) to generate/curate:

New articles, CTAs, quiz questions, offer copy, emotion words, lead magnets, etc.

Auto-score, flag, and A/B/N test AI-generated content.

Admin/Analytics UI

Empire core dashboard /admin/ai-ml-center:

Visualize learning runs, ML weights, archetype stats, experiment charts, content/offer optimization logs, and AI/ML recommendations.

“Manual override” and “push to all neurons” controls.

Security, Audit, and Docs

Audit trail for every AI/ML update, config change, and experiment.

Version history/rollback for all learning/model/config outputs.

Full README update: “AI/ML Centralization Layer — How It Works, How to Extend.”

Rules:

No learning loops in neurons — all ML/AI/optimization must happen in the core only.

All model weights, recommendations, and strategies must be versioned, logged, and explainable (no black box).

Core can run “silent mode” (log only, don’t push changes) for debugging/testing.

DELIVERABLES:

Empire AI/ML orchestrator code and data pipelines (modular, documented)

Updated dashboard (AI/ML center, analytics, overrides, rollout)

All code, tests, configs, and logs exportable
