üöÄ Smart Funnel Generator (Empire Grade, AI-Optimized, Modular & Hardened)

üéØ Objective  
Build a self-evolving, cross-vertical funnel engine that maps, tracks, and automates every conversion path in your empire ‚Äî quiz ‚Üí lead ‚Üí offer ‚Üí upsell ‚Üí retarget ‚Äî with dynamic segmentation, AI-powered testing, and end-to-end analytics.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Funnel Config & Orchestration
- **Visual funnel editor & JSON config:**
  - Define each funnel: entry points (page, quiz, ad, search, notification), path steps (quiz, page, offer, form, product, upsell, exit), triggers, and branching logic.
  - Flexible support for single/multi-step, vertical-specific, persona/segment-based, and micro-funnels.
- **Funnel registry**: `/config/funnels/` or DB collection for scalable management.
- **Dynamic routing engine:**
  - Given any user/session, auto-selects best funnel path based on intent, archetype, source, and session data.
  - AI/ML/Rule-based funnel adaptation: swap steps/offers/flow based on user behavior or performance.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Step Engine & Personalization
- **Step types**: Quiz, lead capture, checkout, offer stack, value page, calculator, blog, video, review, upsell, cross-sell, feedback, retarget.
- **Persona/contextual adaptation**: Swap content/logic per user segment, device, or campaign.
- **A/B/N & multivariate testing**: Randomly assign users to different paths, offers, or CTAs.
- **Trigger logic**: Triggers for time on step, event, inactivity, scroll, click, session dropoff, or external signal (webhook, API).

3Ô∏è‚É£ Analytics, Events & Optimization
- **Full analytics tracking:**
  - Track step completion, drop-off, conversion, click, form fill, time-on-step, scroll depth, upsell/cross-sell acceptance, referral, and retargeting engagement.
  - All data logged per user/session/funnel.
- **Funnel analytics dashboard:**
  - Visualize: conversion %, bottleneck steps, revenue per funnel, LTV, CAC, ROI, per-offer lift.
  - Step-by-step drilldown, segment filter, export to CSV/DB.
- **Auto-optimization:**
  - AI/ML engine suggests funnel tweaks: reorder steps, drop low-performers, test new branches, swap CTAs/offers, based on real-time performance.
  - Automated experiment scheduler (run weekly/monthly tests, report winners).

4Ô∏è‚É£ UI/UX & Experience
- **Drag/drop/clone UI for funnel editing** (for dev/admin), live preview of each step.
- **Front-end funnel navigator:** mobile-first, dynamic progress bar, state save/restore, skip logic.
- **Personalized step content:** live variables for user name, location, intent, persona, etc.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Lifecycle & Retargeting Automation
- **Automated funnel lifecycle logic:**
  - Abandoned funnel reminders (email/push)
  - Re-entry points (re-engage drop-offs)
  - Post-conversion/upsell offers (auto, or by trigger)
  - Drip/email automation: e.g., after quiz, send result, offer, guide, or retargeting CTA

6Ô∏è‚É£ Security & Compliance
- **GDPR/CCPA compliant:** All tracking transparent, export/erase on demand, consent capture per step if needed.
- **JWT/RBAC protected funnel admin endpoints.**

7Ô∏è‚É£ Federation & Integration
- **API for any neuron/module to submit user/event/funnel data, trigger funnel entry, or pull next recommended step.**
- **All funnel events integrated with analytics, notifications, personalization engine.**
- **Empire-wide funnel registry:** no duplicate flows, all shareable/reusable across verticals.

8Ô∏è‚É£ README & Docs
- **README.md must cover:**
  - How to define funnels (JSON/config + UI)
  - Step types & logic
  - Analytics/event tracking
  - AI/ML optimization flow
  - Personalization, lifecycle, compliance
  - How to integrate with empire modules
  - Example configs/flows
  - How to extend/customize funnel logic

Make all database schemas, tables, and logic fully self-healing, migration-immune, and bootstrappable.
If DB is missing, empty, or new: auto-create schema, indexes, constraints, default config.
Pull all credentials (Supabase, etc.) only from .env ‚Äî no hardcode ever.
No direct SQL in UI ‚Äî all logic flows through hardened service/API layer.
Add init checks: validate schema health, retry on fail, show admin alerts if broken.

System must behave as if nothing broke ‚Äî even if DB was replaced 1 minute ago.
Resilience must match billion-dollar SaaS. No placeholders. No assumptions.
---

**DO THIS NOW:**  
- Never duplicate existing code ‚Äî upgrade if present, create if missing.
- All logic must be robust, testable, modular, and exportable for use across the empire.
- Output all backend code, UI components, analytics, admin UI, and a full README.
