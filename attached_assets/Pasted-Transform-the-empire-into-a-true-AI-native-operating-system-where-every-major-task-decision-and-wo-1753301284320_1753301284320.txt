Transform the empire into a true AI-native operating system‚Äîwhere every major task, decision, and workflow is routed to the right AI/LLM/agent, executed in parallel, and orchestrated for maximum speed, autonomy, personalization, and self-evolution.

üß† 1. LLM Brain Router
Register all available LLMs/agents (OpenAI, LocalAI, Claude, Llama, Ollama, custom micro-models, etc.) with:

Name, task specialties, cost, quota, rate limits, latency, GPU/memory type

Dynamic routing engine:

Given a request/task, auto-selects the best LLM/agent based on task type, availability, performance history, and quota

Supports fallback, parallel routing, split-routing, and sandbox testing

Handles secure API keys, retries, quota exhaustion, cost logging

Built-in registry for pluggable new agents

Central Admin UI:

Add/remove/update agents

View logs, usage stats, cost breakdown, latency, fallback rate

üß† 1A. LLM Memory, Feedback & Skill Learning
Agents/LLMs store vectorized task memories in shared embedding DB (ChromaDB, Weaviate, LanceDB, etc.)

Each agent maintains:

Prompt templates ("skills")

Task logs, performance logs

Feedback loops (manual and automatic based on conversion/outcome)

Memory enhances future task performance and re-routes tasks based on past failures or improvements

üîÅ 1B. Adaptive Routing AI (Self-Tuning Router)
The router learns and adapts routing rules based on:

Task type + complexity

Model past success rate

Failure history and latency/cost scores

Supports internal training of a meta-model (e.g., XGBoost or fine-tuned LLM) to decide routing path

Automatically avoids known-failing routes during degraded states or outages

üß¨ 1C. Prompt Graph Compiler
Supports prompt chaining with context passing and memory injection across agents

Dynamic generation of prompt graphs (like LangGraph, ReAct, Tree-of-Thoughts)

Supports conditional routing, error recovery chains, and reusable "prompt functions"

‚ö°Ô∏è 2. Agentic Workflow Engine
Visual + code workflow builder:

Multi-step chains (e.g., Fetch ‚Üí Summarize ‚Üí Categorize ‚Üí Update DB ‚Üí Trigger CTA)

Conditional logic, branching, wait/pause, manual override

Parallel and scheduled runs, cron support, retry on fail

Workflow Library:

Reusable blueprints for product scraping, offer matching, blog refreshing, traffic tuning, quiz syncing, and semantic graph updates

Analytics per workflow:

Time, tokens, latency, conversion impact, fail/pass rates

üõ∞ 3. Federation Integration + Task Marketplace
Any neuron/module can:

Submit task or workflow to LLM Brain (via REST, gRPC, or event bus)

Receive results or register handlers for real-time task response

Remote neurons can register their own agents to the Federation Brain (like a decentralized AI worker pool)

Federation Core balances load, tracks results, and shares routing intelligence across the network

üí£ 4. Chaos Resilience + Cost Governance
Auto-kill or throttle agents when:

Token cost exceeds threshold

Agent underperforms or enters degraded state

Canary deploy mode for testing new agents/workflows

Cost-aware routing + usage caps per day/user/project/team

üîí 5. Security, Logging, Governance
JWT + RBAC on all endpoints and workflow triggers

Audit logs:

All agent activity

Input/output diffs

Manual override trail

Alerting on:

Cost spikes

Agent downtime

Security/prompt injection patterns

üìò 6. README (MANDATORY)
How to:

Register agents (OpenAI, Ollama, Claude, LocalAI, etc.)

Build adaptive workflows (fallback + parallel chains)

Setup embedding memory + feedback loop

Sync with Federation Core and submit tasks cross-neuron

Sample configs:

Agent definitions

Adaptive routing logic

Workflow graphs (YAML/JSON)

Cost/time/performance logs
