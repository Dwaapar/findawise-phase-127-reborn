Phase 5 — Scaling & Automation (CLI/Dashboard for Infinite Neurons)
Now you’re building the “Empire Launchpad.”
This phase is where your system becomes “one-click deploy,” infinitely scalable, and ready for world domination.

Phase 5: Scaling & Automation
GOAL:
Enable anyone (you, your ops team, future AI agents) to clone, onboard, deploy, and monitor 100+ neurons, live, in seconds.

Provide a CLI tool and/or a dashboard for neuron lifecycle (add, retire, monitor, bulk update, hotfix, etc).

This is “Zapier-for-Neurons,” your empire’s true engine room.

YOUR PHASE 5 PROMPT (Ready for Replit, LLM, or real dev):
Phase 5: Scaling & Automation — Infinite Neuron Rollout

Objective:
Build CLI tooling and/or an empire dashboard for the automated lifecycle management of neurons.
Instantly add, clone, update, monitor, and retire neurons at scale.

MANDATORY FEATURES:
CLI Tooling

findawise-cli command line tool (or equivalent) for:

Spinning up a new neuron from template or config (neuron create --niche=finance)

Cloning/scaling existing neuron configs/codebase (neuron clone --source=saas --niche=edtech)

Bulk onboarding from CSV or config files (onboard 10–100 neurons in a single command)

Retire/activate/deploy/update neurons (neuron retire --id=abc123)

Live status, healthcheck, and config sync via CLI

All CLI actions are logged, secure (tokenized), and RBAC controlled

Dashboard UI (Optional/Recommended)

All above functions available via a dashboard page /admin/empire-launchpad

Visual neuron map: all verticals, health, traffic, status, scaling buttons

“Bulk deploy/retire” button and log console

API Integration

All CLI/dashboard actions use the same core federation APIs (register, config, analytics, etc.)

Support for headless neurons (API-only), UI neurons, and future verticals

Monitoring & Analytics

Live stats for all neurons: traffic, errors, health, config version, analytics, uptime

Automated alerts for failed deploys, offline neurons, or scaling errors

Downloadable/exportable status and analytics reports

Docs & Onboarding

Full README.md and/or CLI help docs:

All commands/options

Troubleshooting, logs, security

How to scale empire to 100–1000 neurons

Rules:

No manual code for new neurons—must be automated via CLI/dashboard

All new neurons must auto-register, auto-config, and be visible in dashboard

All logs/actions must be audit-trailed and exportable

CLI must work on Mac, Linux, and (ideally) Windows

DELIVERABLES:

findawise-cli (or equivalent) production-ready tool (with docs)

Updated dashboard with scaling features
