You are continuing findawise empire 
you are adding one more external neuron module in neural federation bridge
Project Name: neuron-ai-tools
You are now building a mastercrafted, AI-powered, modular micro-app called neuron-ai-tools. This neuron is part of the Neuron Federation Bridge — a high-intelligence digital system within the Findawise Empire Brain, designed to scale across 1,000+ niches.

Its purpose:

To become the most trusted, dynamic, and intelligent AI tools directory and assistant — continuously evolving, crawling the web, optimizing UX, and helping users discover the best AI-powered solutions for any task, budget, or goal.

⚙️ MANDATORY: Federation OS Protocols
🔗 POST /api/neuron/register on boot (name, type, URL, supported features, token)

📡 POST /api/neuron/status every 60 seconds (health, uptime, analytics)

📥 Pull latest config/experiments via /api/neuron/update-config

📊 Report all analytics/events to /api/analytics/report

🔐 Secure all endpoints via API token from .env

💎 Core Modules to Implement
Module File	Purpose
QuizEngine.tsx	Personalized quiz for AI tool discovery
OfferManager.ts	Renders, rotates, and cloaks affiliate offers dynamically
ConfigSync.ts	Handles pulling & applying orchestrator updates from core
AnalyticsClient.ts	Tracks all user events, sends payloads to the Empire Core
SelfEvolveAgent.ts	Runs AI experiments, performance audits, and auto-improvements
ToolDirectory.tsx	Filters, ranks, and shows all AI tools dynamically
LeadMagnetFlow.tsx	Collects emails with eBooks, templates, bonus tools
ExportManager.ts	Exports config/content/analytics in .neuron.json format

🔍 Niche Specialization: AI Tools
This neuron is built for:

Tool researchers, prompt engineers, creators, and entrepreneurs

Users searching for AI tools by category, use-case, or budget

Affiliate monetization through cloaked outbound links with click tracking

Content Stack (autonomous + curated):
✅ Auto-scraped and AI-curated tool database (title, pricing, use-case, platform, rating, pros/cons)

✅ 50+ SEO-rich blog articles: comparisons, guides, trends, prompt libraries

✅ Dynamic affiliate offer rendering: config-driven, performance-aware rotation

✅ Comparison tables, carousels, category filters, emotion-based sorting (ease, power, speed, creativity)

✅ Advanced filters (free/paid, lifetime deal, category, popularity, integrations)

Personalization & AI Engine:
Auto-detect user archetype: Explorer, Engineer, Growth Hacker, Creator, Researcher

Quiz-based tool suggestion engine with memory of past choices

AI-generated recommendations + tool rankings per user session

Emotion-mapped tool layout and color scheme:

Power Seeker → sharp UI, contrast-heavy

Creator → colorful, inspiration-first

Efficiency Lover → minimalist, snappy nav

🧠 Self-Evolving Intelligence (MANDATORY)
This neuron evolves autonomously by:

🔄 A/B testing CTAs, hero headlines, layout orders, quiz logic, etc.

🤖 Cron-triggered experiments (content performance, offer CTR, bounce rates)

🔍 Auto-detect underperforming tools → rotate or remove

🧠 Auto-generate new blog sections using OpenAI API (Orchestrator injected)

🛠️ Dynamic offer injection via affiliate API integration (e.g., AppSumo, G2)

Trigger self-healing fallback when:

Analytics error rate > 5% over 60s

Offer click-through < 0.5%

Data sync failure over 2 retries

📄 README + Federation Documentation
Ensure updates are made to the main:

README.md (project purpose, how to clone, customize, scale, integrate)

replit.md (local setup, API endpoints, federation logic)

Do NOT create new files. Append to existing documentation files.

🧩 Federation Scaling Logic
This neuron must be:

🔁 Cloneable into neuron-prompts, neuron-ai-design, neuron-ai-coding, etc.

🧱 Modular: all offers, layouts, tools, and content pulled from config/slots

🛡️ Secure: all outbound URLs pass through cloaked redirect handlers

✅ Summary of Key Must-Haves:
100+ curated + AI-generated tools

Fully interactive, emotion-mapped, modular UI

Affiliate cloaking and tracking

Personalization by user intent

Auto-evolving through experiments and orchestrator control

Full backup/export logic

Strict Federation compliance: registration, heartbeat, status, analytics

Prepares a plug-and-play knowledge base for the Empire
