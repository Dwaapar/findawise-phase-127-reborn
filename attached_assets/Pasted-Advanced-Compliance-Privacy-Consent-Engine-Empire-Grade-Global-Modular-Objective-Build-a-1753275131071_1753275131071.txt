Advanced Compliance/Privacy/Consent Engine (Empire-Grade, Global, Modular)

🎯 Objective:
Build a global, multi-layer compliance engine that handles privacy, consent, affiliate/network disclosure, and user data controls across all modules, verticals, and devices.

---

🔩 1. Consent Management Layer
- Dynamic consent banner (auto-detects region, language, legal requirement)
    - GDPR, CCPA, LGPD, ePrivacy, PECR, and custom regional policies
    - Consent for cookies, analytics, affiliate links, personalization, email/push
- “Edit preferences” and “withdraw consent” UI (persistent in profile/settings)
- Per-vertical, per-country, per-user group custom consent flows

---

⚡️ 2. Privacy Policy & User Data Control
- Auto-generates privacy policy, T&C, affiliate/network disclosures per vertical/niche/region (LLM-powered summaries, legal templates)
- User dashboard: download data, request deletion (“erase me” per GDPR/CCPA), opt out, manage notification/personalization settings
- All logs, consents, requests, and disclosures are timestamped and exportable

---

🧠 3. Compliance with Affiliate & Ad Networks
- Automated detection and display of required disclosures on every affiliate offer, ad block, or paid placement (per network rules: Amazon, Google, etc.)
- “Geo-ban” logic—auto-hides restricted offers/networks in forbidden regions
- Real-time monitoring of compliance issues, violations, and change alerts
- Auto-archive of expired offers, revoked consents, banned users/networks

---

🔗 4. Security, Audit, and RBAC
- Role-based admin UI for managing all compliance policies, reviewing requests, audit logs, and user consents
- Security: API access control, encrypted storage of consents/logs, audit trail of changes
- Automated compliance scan (weekly, monthly): flags outdated policies, missing disclosures, expired data, etc.

---

📘 5. README (MANDATORY)
- Full docs: consent banner, compliance flows, privacy/data handling, admin controls, regional logic, affiliate/ad disclosures, API for neurons
- Sample privacy policy, T&C, and affiliate disclosure auto-generation
- Export/import compliance logs, audit trail, request templates

---

💥 Output Requirements:
- Fully working, modular, exportable consent/privacy engine
- All compliance logic live/testable for at least 2 regions/networks
- Admin UI, API endpoints, auto-generated docs, logs, export scripts
