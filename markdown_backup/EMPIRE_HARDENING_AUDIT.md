# 🏛️ EMPIRE HARDENING AUDIT REPORT
**FINDAWISE NEURAL EMPIRE - SYSTEMATIC UPGRADE TO TRILLION-DOLLAR STANDARDS**

## 🎯 MISSION STATUS: ACTIVE
**Started:** 2025-01-21T21:35:00Z  
**Phase:** Critical Infrastructure Hardening  
**Priority:** EMPEROR-LEVEL (NO WEAKNESS TOLERATED)

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED
### 1. TypeScript Errors (89 total)
- **server/routes.ts**: 71 errors (unknown error types, missing session properties)
- **client/src/pages/admin/affiliate-dashboard.tsx**: 10 errors
- **client/src/pages/admin/neuron-federation.tsx**: 8 errors

### 2. SQL Syntax Issues (FIXED)
