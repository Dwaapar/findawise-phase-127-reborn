### Advanced Reliability Implementation:
1. **Enterprise Error Handling** (`server/services/reliability/errorHandling.ts`)
   - Incident classification system (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, INFO)
   - Circuit breaker pattern with automatic service fallback
   - Exponential backoff retry logic with jitter
   - Comprehensive health monitoring for all components
   - Auto-recovery mechanisms with strategy patterns

2. **Production-Grade Features**
