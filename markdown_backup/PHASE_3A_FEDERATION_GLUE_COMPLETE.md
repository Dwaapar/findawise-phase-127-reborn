  - Real-time message broadcasting capabilities
  - Configuration and experiment push capabilities
  - Comprehensive audit logging integration

### 2. Federation Control Center Dashboard
- **RealtimeDashboard Component** (`client/src/components/federation/RealtimeDashboard.tsx`)
  - Live neuron status monitoring with real-time updates
  - System-wide metrics aggregation (Page Views, Users, Revenue, Health)
  - Interactive live/pause mode toggle
  - Connection status visualization
  - Health score progress indicators
  - Uptime and performance tracking

### 3. Enhanced Federation Routes

  - `/api/federation/dashboard/realtime` - Live dashboard data
  - `/api/federation/websocket/status` - WebSocket connection monitoring
  - Real-time neuron metrics aggregation
  - Connection status tracking
  - Performance analytics integration

### 4. Integration Layer
- **Server Integration** (`server/index.ts`)
  - WebSocket manager initialization on server startup
  - Integration with existing federation OS
  - Seamless HTTP/WebSocket hybrid architecture

### 5. Fixed Components
- **AuditAndHistory Component** - Fixed TypeScript diagnostics
  - Proper data type handling for API responses
  - Enhanced error state management
  - Improved query response handling

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### WebSocket Communication Flow
1. **Neuron Registration**: Neurons connect and register with metadata
2. **Heartbeat System**: Regular health checks and connection monitoring
3. **Real-time Updates**: Live status broadcasts to admin dashboard
4. **Configuration Push**: Real-time config deployment via WebSocket
5. **Analytics Streaming**: Live metrics aggregation and visualization

### Dashboard Components
- **Live Metrics Cards**: Active neurons, page views, users, revenue
- **Health Monitoring**: Average health scores with progress indicators
- **Connection Status**: Real-time WebSocket connection tracking
- **Neuron Table**: Comprehensive status overview with live updates
- **Alert System**: System notifications and health alerts

### Enterprise-Grade Features
- **Connection Management**: Automatic reconnection and cleanup
- **Message Broadcasting**: Targeted and global message distribution
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all federation operations
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time system health tracking
- **Security**: Connection verification and authentication

## üìä Live Dashboard Features

### System Metrics
- **Active Neurons**: Total registered neurons with connection status
- **Page Views**: Real-time traffic aggregation across all neurons
- **Active Users**: Current user count federation-wide
- **Revenue**: Live revenue tracking and reporting
- **Average Health**: System health score with visual indicators
- **System Uptime**: Total federation uptime tracking
- **Status Overview**: Comprehensive system health indicator

### Real-time Capabilities
- **5-second refresh** in live mode
- **WebSocket integration** for instant updates
- **Connection monitoring** with visual indicators
- **Live activity stream** (prepared for future implementation)
- **Interactive controls** for pause/resume functionality

## üîß Implementation Details

### Key Files Created/Modified
1. `server/services/federation/webSocketManager.ts` - WebSocket infrastructure
2. `client/src/components/federation/RealtimeDashboard.tsx` - Live dashboard
3. `server/routes/federation.ts` - Real-time API endpoints
4. `server/index.ts` - WebSocket integration
5. `client/src/components/federation/AuditAndHistory.tsx` - Fixed diagnostics

### Database Integration
