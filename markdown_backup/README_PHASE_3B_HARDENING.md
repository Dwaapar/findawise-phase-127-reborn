## Operational Procedures

### How to Test Federation at Scale
1. **Start Federation System**: Ensure all services running on port 5000
2. **Run Stress Test**: `./scripts/run-stress-test.sh 30 600`
3. **Monitor Dashboard**: Watch real-time metrics at `/admin/neuron-federation`
4. **Verify Results**: Review generated report in `test-results/`
5. **Cleanup**: Test data automatically cleaned up

### How to Handle Production Failures
1. **Detection**: Failures auto-detected within 60 seconds
2. **Notification**: Check federation dashboard for alerts  
3. **Investigation**: Review failure details via API or dashboard
4. **Recovery**: Automatic recovery attempted, manual override available
5. **Audit**: All actions logged in comprehensive audit trail

### Scaling to 100+ Neurons
- **Database Optimization**: Consider connection pooling and read replicas
- **WebSocket Scaling**: Implement horizontal scaling with sticky sessions
- **Monitoring**: Deploy external monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana)
- **Load Balancing**: Use nginx or similar for API endpoint distribution
- **Health Checks**: Consider dedicated health check services

## Known Issues & Mitigations

### Current Limitations
- **WebSocket Scaling**: Single server instance limits concurrent connections
- **Database Load**: High neuron counts may require optimization
- **Memory Usage**: Large audit logs may require archival strategy

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Ready for multi-instance deployment
- **Database Sharding**: Schema supports partitioning by neuron type
- **Audit Archival**: Automated cleanup with 90-day retention
- **Circuit Breakers**: Implemented for external service calls

## Next Steps & Recommendations

### Immediate (Production Ready)
1. ✅ Deploy to staging environment with 20+ real neurons
2. ✅ Implement external monitoring dashboards  
3. ✅ Set up automated backup procedures
4. ✅ Configure production security policies

### Short Term (Scale to 100+)
1. **Load Balancer Setup**: Nginx with sticky sessions
2. **Database Optimization**: Connection pooling and indexing
3. **Monitoring Integration**: Prometheus metrics collection
4. **Alerting System**: PagerDuty or similar integration

### Long Term (Global Scale)
1. **Multi-region Deployment**: Geographic distribution
2. **Advanced Analytics**: Machine learning for predictive failure detection
3. **API Gateway**: Rate limiting and authentication at gateway level
4. **Data Lake Integration**: Historical analytics and trend analysis
